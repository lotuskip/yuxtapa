This directory includes the source code of some helper programs. They should
be of interest only to people who develop yuxtapa.

anims.cpp
	Used to test the "update animations"; you can use this to see how a non-
	laggy update indicator looks like... Give the animation string (just like
	the ones in client.conf) as the 1st argument, and turn length as the 2nd;
	default for this is 250(ms). Compile with -lncursesw

lostbl.cpp
	Used to generate the ../common/los_lookup.h file. (Runs Bresenham's
	algorithm on a large set of points.)

scenecol.cpp
	Used to test the colour values in ../client/colourdef.h. Prints stuff
	like you see when playing, using the colour definitions given in the
	header file. Also works for testing terminals and fonts, obviously.
	Compile with -lncursesw

mrbrown.cpp
	Since I don't have enough interested Linux-using friends to test the
	game with multiple players, I wrote this idiot bot client, that just
	kind of walks around randomly (hence the name). It is usually spawned
	as a child process to the server.
	UPDATE: now they actually do some not-quite-idiotic stuff, too.

To compile any of these except mrbrown, do
	g++ -o NAME -O2 NAME.cpp [-lncursesw]
See the manual page on bots for mrbrown's installation information.

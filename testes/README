This directory includes the source code of some helper programs. They should
be of interest only to people who develop yuxtapa.

anims.cpp
	Used to test the "update animations"; you can use this to see how a non-
	laggy update indicator looks like... Doesn't do unicode like the client
	does. Compile with -lncurses

lostbl.cpp
	Used to generate the ../common/los_lookup.h file. (Runs Bresenham's
	algorithm on a large set of points.)

scenecol.cpp
	Used to test the colour values in ../client/colourdef.h. Prints stuff
	like you see when playing, using the colour definitions given in the
	header file. Also works for testing terminals and fonts, obviously.
	Compile with -lncurses

mrbrown.cpp
	Since I don't have enough interested Linux-using friends to test the
	game with multiple players, I wrote this idiot bot client, that just
	kind of walks around randomly (hence the name). It keeps running until
	the server shuts down. If anyone wants to write actual bots for yuxtapa,
	this is the starting point: all it needs is a bit of AI!

To compile any of these except mrbrown, do
	g++ -o NAME -O2 NAME.cpp [-lncurses]
See the manual page on bots for mrbrown's installation information.

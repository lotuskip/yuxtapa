#yuxtapa server configuration file

#Empty lines and lines starting with a '#' are ignored.

# Maximum number of simultaneously connected players; 2-200, default 25
#
#maxplayers [number]
maxplayers 25

# Map size and variation. The map size is
#   'mapsize' +/- 'mapsizevar'%
# mapsize has to be 70-365 (default 100), and mapsizevar has to be 0-40
# (this is in percents of mapsize, default is 20).
#
#mapsize [base size]
#mapsizevar [% to vary]
mapsize 100
mapsizevar 20

# Directory for saved maps. If specified, any maps saved by admins with
# the "!storemap X" command are put in this directory, in a file called 'X'.
# To disable saving maps, leave this setting undefined; this is the default.
# Always give the full path and make sure the directory exists.
#
#mapdir [directory]
#mapdir /home/user/.local/share/yuxtapa_maps/

# Class limitation. If specified and not 0, only so many player characters
# of the same class are allowed per team. It can be at most 'maxplayers'/22
# (as there are 11 classes and 2 teams). The default is 0, i.e. no limit.
#
#classlimit [limit]
classlimit 0

# Turn duration. How many milliseconds is one turn. You really should not
# change this from the default value of 250 unless it is absolutely
# necessary to improve performance (greater value stresses the server less)
# or you want to experiment with faster gameplay.
#
# The allowed range is 50-2000.
#
#turnms [ms]
turnms 250

# Intermission duration in seconds, 10-120, default 45.
#
#interm [secs]
interm 45

# The server port. You must tell this to the players so that they can
# connect. The allowed range is 1024-61000, default 12360.
#
#port [port number]
port 12360

# IP version to use. This is '4' or '6', for IPv4 and IPv6, respectively.
# If '0', the server will just use whichever is the system default. This is
# the default.
#
#ipv [0/4/6]
ipv 0

# Stat purging; how many hours should the server store players'
# statistics if they don't visit the server. Set to 0 to store
# indefinitely. Default is 24 hours.
#
# Purging only affects "guests" and "regulars"; players whose admin
# level is at least "trusted user" are never purged.
#
#statpurge [hours]
statpurge 24

# Server greeting message. This string is displayed to all newly
# connected clients. Make sure it is all on one line in the config
# file. UTF-8 is allowed. The string cannot be extremely long. The
# default value is an empty string.
#
#greeting [string]
greeting Welcome to the anonymous yuxtapa server whose admin is happy with the example greeting!

# Team balance setting. There are three possible settings for the server
# team balance handling: (default is 'passive')
#
# 'off': do not enforce team balance in any way; allow all team switches
#
# 'passive': do not allow team switches that would make the teams unbalanced
#
# 'active': the same as passive, + enforce a shuffling of the teams if they
# remain unbalanced for too long (the players are warned in advance)
#
#teambalance [setting]
teambalance passive

# Playing mode. Read the manual for descriptions of the modes. The recognised
# values are:
#   'dominion'
#   'conquest'
#   'steal'
#   'destroy'
#   'team-dm'
# These should be put in a space-separated list. The actual mode to use is
# then chosen randomly. The default behaviour, if this setting is missing,
# is to include all the modes in the consideration.
#
# It is possible to repeat the same mode several times. This makes it more
# probable that it is played. For instance, defining
#mode steal steal destroy
# means that there is a 2/3 chance of playing in steal mode and only 1/3
# chance of playing in destroy mode (other modes having 0 chance).
#
#mode [list of modes, space separated]
mode dominion conquest steal destroy team-dm

# Map types. This entry works just like the 'mode' entry above. Recognised
# values are
#   'dungeon'
#   'outdoor'
#   'complex'
# By default, each is included in the list once.
#
#maptype [list of map types, space separated]
maptype dungeon outdoor complex

# Safe chasms. Players are first warned when they are about to walk into a
# chasm and only fall if they walk into a chasm tile [safe_chasms] times.
# The counter is reset upon death. If 0, walking into a chasm tile results
# in immediate death (this is the "old" way it worked). Default is 1.
#
#safe_chasms [0-255]
safe_chasms 1

# Bot executable. If you want to use bots, give here the FULL PATH to their
# executable. To disable bots, simply skip this entry. By default, bots are
# disabled. See the manual page on bots for a method to define the port
# for the bots if it is not the default 12360.
#
#bots [path]
#bots /usr/bin/yuxtapa_mrb

# Bot names. Bots will be named using the names listed here (reusing the
# names starting from the first when each has been used once). Give a list
# of space separated names. If you want to have spaces in the name, use
# the symbol '_' instead of the space; e.g. "Mr._Brown" will be changed
# into "Mr. Brown".
#
# Note that the bot names are limited to 10 symbols just like player names.
#
# The default, for "historical reasons", is to call all bots "Mr. Brown".
#
#botnames [space separated list of bot names]
botnames Mr._Neon Mr._Brown Mr._Pink Aimblind

# Minimum number of players; 0-maxplayers, default 0. If there is at least one
# non-bot player and the total number of players is less than the minimum, the
# server will automatically spawn enough bots to meet the minimum. As human
# players connect, bots are automatically dropped.
#
#minplayers [number]
minplayers 0

# Disabled commands. You can disable any of the server commands (see
# manual page on chatting) from use. By default, nothing is disabled.
# Do not include the preceding '!' in the command names. You can only
# disable an entire command, not a specific application of it (e.g. you
# cannot declare that "!setclass archer" is disabled, but must disable
# the use of "!setclass" altogether.) For example:
#ban_command setclass putteam plinfo

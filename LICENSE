                    NOTHING TO SEE HERE, version 1

There is no 'license' for this software, as there should be no license for any
software or 'patent' for any invention. There is no 'copyright', either. There
are merely these humble wishes of the author:

1. Please do not abuse this software in any way.
2. Please do not cause any harm or demerit to the author. Or to anyone else.
3. Please take a moment to contemplate on how our inability to trust one
   another is a major reason for many of the problems of our society.
4. Please do not call 'naive' the good people who agree. It is rude and serves
   no valuable purpose.

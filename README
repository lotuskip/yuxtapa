# The first "release" of this game is not ready yet, #
# but will be soon, hopefully. Hence, the homepage   #
# given below doesn't even exist yet. The game is    #
# still lacking a couple of features and large-scale #
# testing. The rest of this file is not quite        #
# relevant just yet. Tnank you.                      #

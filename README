yux+apa, version 6

yuxtapa is a multiplayer game; text-based, real-time, and open-source.
Taking most of its influences from roguelike games and team-oriented
multiplayer first-person shooters, it is rather difficult to describe
briefly. The package includes a manual with some screenshots.

The game is at the moment only available for Linux-like operating systems.
It is still being developed further, but is fully playable and already fairly
rich in features. yuxtapa is written in C++ and uses NCurses for the visual
stuff.

yux+apa, version 9a

yuxtapa is a multiplayer game; text-based, real-time, and open-source.
Taking most of its influences from roguelike games and team-oriented
multiplayer first-person shooters, it is rather difficult to describe
briefly. The package includes a manual with some screenshots.

The game is at the moment only available for Linux-like operating systems.
It is considered 'finished', but major bugs will, if reported and time
allowing, be fixed, and it is not carved in stone that there won't some day
be released a version with wholly new features.

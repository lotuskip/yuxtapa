<h2>yuxtapa version history &amp; changelogs</h2>

<p>Versions are listed in chronological order by release date, newest first.</p>
<p>If the version string in the title is underlined, it begins a new development
branch (versions in different branches are never compatible).</p>
<p>If a version number is followed by a letter, eg. &quot;version 4a&quot;, this
is a fix/update in an old development branch (that of version 4 in the
example). Any modifications and additions in version <em>n</em>[a-z] are always
implicitly present also in the version listed right before that version
(in the example's case, anything mentioned in version 4a is also present in
version 5), but changes that are explicitly listed for a version of a new
branch are never present in updates of any old branches (eg. things mentioned for
version 5 do not appear in version 4b, even though 4b is released later
than 5).</p>
<p>A change or a new feature should always imply the respective update in the
manual. Please report any out-of-date information you find there,
<strong>but</strong> note that
the manual of the old branch (version 4x) is not being updated anymore.</p>
<p>A <font color="red">known issue</font> is something that was noticed just
prior to release (the aim is then to fix them by the next release), or something
that appears to be a problem in some dependency rather than yuxtapa. Notifications of
bugs are not added retrospectively to listings for old versions, though.</p>

<li><font color="red">known issue</font>: (this has been around for ever)
something strange is wrong with resetting the terminal colours on urxvt when the

</ul>
</p>

<p><strong>Server:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Additions:
<ul>
<li>New config entry 'ipv' that can be used to tell the server explicitly to use
IPv4 or IPv6 (see the new server.conf template)</li>
<li>Poisoned PCs now have their view disturbed by sickly green flickering</li>
<li>Treasure item now has different colour when lying in water or in chasm</li>

<li>If the teams have the same number of players, a newly joining player can now
also be put into the purple team if the class they requested is not available in
the green team</li>

takes longer)</li>

level</li>
</ul></li>

<li>Fixed how joining new players didn't receive the flag map right away</li>
<li>No more than one flag can now be generated per sector (bugfix)</li>

immediately)</li>
<li>Fixed (in a brutal way) a fatal bug in map generation</li>
<li>Fixed two issues with switching class (switching <em>back</em> to current
class; and not being informed of new class if &quot;killed&quot; by
intermission)</li>
<li>Let zombie bots be reaped</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</p>

<p><strong>Bots:</strong>

<hr>

<p><strong>version 4e</strong> released Apr 19, 2012</p>

<p><strong>Server:</strong>

</ul></p>

<p>Same remark as below for version 4d.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>version 8</strong> released Feb 5, 2012</p>

<p><strong>Client:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Introduced the alternative &quot;send mode&quot;; see the new client.conf
file</li>
<li>Message box now &quot;dimmens&quot; the older messages; implementing
this has caused some changes in the server, too</li>
<li>Help screen shows space visibly (as 'SP') and tab properly (as '\t')</li>
<li><font color="red">known issue</font>: on a recent version of urxvt, the
client is terribly slow to start (the cause has been narrowed down to the ncurses
routine init_color; the problem does not arise on xterm or if the
TERM variable is set so that colour values cannot be changed in urxvt)</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p><strong>Server:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a couple of logic errors in steal mode</li>
<li>Fixed issues with the LOS (and lighting) algorithm</li>
<li>Fixed background colour indicators, which had been broken for a few
versions...</li>
<li>Bots are now identified as (B) in the team listings, instead of (G)</li>
<li>PCs dying in water don't leave a corpse</li>
<li>Bots trying to pick an unavailable class now get assigned another class
(this is the way it has been documented to be all along, but apparently never was...)</li>
<li>Amount of drowning damage now depends on the max hps of the class (so
classes with a lot of hps will, on the average, drown just as fast as others)</li>
<li>While drowning, PCs now create a splashing sound (regardless of class)</li>
<li>You can now hear (see) sounds when blinded</li>
<li>The mode of the next map now again uses the sector abbreviations</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p><strong>General:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Removed C++ boost from dependencies</li>
<li>Fixed a very minor, almost theoretical bug having to do with random numbers</li>
<li>Fixed some compilation issues with the latest gcc/glibc</li>
<li>Added some critical documentation, particularly on running multiple servers
and using bots when the server uses a non-default port</li>
<li>Added a quite pointless but cute vim syntax file for yuxtapa maps</li>
<li>Added a script to generate empty map files for manual map design
purposes</li>
</ul></p>

<p><strong>Bot improvements:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Suicide decision now based on time of isolation instead of interpreting a single view</li>
<li>Fixed the problem of bots spawning close to a chasm almost inevitably walking into
it</li>
</ul></p>

<p><strong>Compatability:</strong>
<ul>
<li>client v.8 might experience some display issues when interacting with a server v.7</li>
</ul></p>

<hr>

<p><strong>version 4d</strong> released Feb 5, 2012</p>

<li>maximum accepted quickshout length is now such that they fit on a single line</li>
</ul></p>

<p><strong>Server:</strong>
<ul>
<li>fixed a bug causing a segfault when mind's eye was used to detect traps at
the edge of the map</li>
<li>illusory walls (PCs can walk and missiles will fly through)</li>
<li>added definite article to the messages for capturing flags</li>
</ul></p>

<p><strong>Common:</strong>
<ul>
<li>too long UTF-8 strings in the configs are now properly cropped</li>
</ul></p>

<p><strong>Bot improvements:</strong>

<li>the AI now correctly interprets brown PCs as teammates (instead of ignoring them)</li>
<li>tweaking of bot archery, which was flawed and bugged</li>
</ul></p>

<p><strong>Compatability:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Fully compatible with v. 6</li>
<li>Client configuration template now provides some &quot;default&quot; quick
shouts</li>
</ul></p>

<hr>

<p><strong>version 4c</strong> released Jan 21, 2012</p>

<p><strong>Server:</strong>
<ul>
<li>fixed a bug in minimap generation for very small maps</li>
<li>fixed how a (malicious or buggy) client could crash the server by having an

</ul></p>

<p>Same remark as below for version 4b.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>version 6</strong> released Nov 17, 2011</p>

<p><strong>Client:</strong>
<ul>
<li>previously typed message scrolling now works like in vim: only strings
matching what you've already typed are suggested</li>
<li>default key for 'C'hat/'C'ommand changed into <em>tab</em></li>
<li>typing mode can now be exited with escape, too, and the escape delay is set
so low that this isn't annoyingly slow</li>
<li>message aliasing now replaces substrings, too!</li>
<li>client can be made to remember messages typed in previous sessions; new
config variable <em>stored_chat_msgs</em> for this purpose</li>
</ul></p>

<p><strong>Server:</strong>
<ul>
<li>miners can destroy doors</li>
<li>made backstabbing requirements easier (a fix of a design flaw): remaining
hiding is easier, and you can backstab blinded enemies</li>
<li>if you suicide while poisoned and have only one hp, the poisoner earns a
kill (&quot;scared to death&quot; supersedes this, though)</li>
<li>messages now use long names for sectors, e.g. &quot;south-east&quot; instead
of &quot;SE&quot;</li>
<li>in steal mode the location of the item is now updated if the item is
dropped</li>
<li>bots are now informed of the turn duration setting (they used to just assume
it's 250ms)</li>
<li>new game mode, <em>team deathmatch</em></li>
<li>server stat printing modified a bit; in particular, accuracy is no longer 0%
if the player never fired a single shot</li>
<li>new chat commands: <em>!howfair</em>, <em>!lscmd</em></li>
<li>possibility of disabling specific commands in server config</li>
</ul></p>

<p><strong>Bot improvements:</strong>
<ul>
<li>many improvements on how bots move around
<ul>
<li>generally, bots will move towards enemies in sight</li>
<li>if there are no enemies, they will move towards any sounds they hear (which
can be used to pull teammate bots to follow you; but note that there is no real
pathfinding)</li>
<li>assassin and trapper bots will favour tiles which allow them to hide</li>
<li>if stuck (e.g. teleported into a tiny room), bots commit suicide</li>
<li>in lack of other controlling conditions, instead of moving entirely
randomly, bots &quot;remain on course&quot; for the most part</li>
</ul></li>
<li>special ability usage:
<ul>
<li>healer bots can heal themselves and bypassing teammates, and poison
bypassing enemies</li>
<li>wizard bots cast mm when they deem it safe and useful</li>
<li>fighter bots use circle strikes in melee when no teammates are close</li>
<li>archer bots shoot arrows at enemies if they have a clear shot (can get
hazardous)</li>
<li>miner bots can on occasion mine walls</li>
<li>trapper bots set traps every once in a while (and might sometimes
accidentally disarm them, too)</li>
<li>mindcrafter bots might blink away from melee if they are low on hps</li>
</ul></li>
<li>bots won't intentionally spawn as any of the &quot;unruled&quot; classes:
scout, planewalker, combat mage (they can still spawn as these due to
classlimiting)</li>
<li>you can check the bot executable version with &quot;mrbrown -v&quot;</li>
</ul></p>

<p><strong>compatability:</strong>
<ul>
<li>server and client are compatible with v.5 clients and servers, but bot
compatability is broken!</li>
<li>new .conf templates with info on new features</li>
</ul></p>

<hr>

<p><strong>version 4b</strong> released Nov 17, 2011</p>

<p><strong>Client:</strong>
<ul>
<li>fixed (a very old) bug that printed titles close to the edge of the view
wrong</li>
<li>fixed (another very old) bug that allowed clients to send too long
strings</li>
<li>curious namespace issue prevented the client from compiling on GCC 4.6.0;
fixed this (nothing changed)</li>
</ul></p>

<p><strong>Server:</strong>
<ul>
<li>fixed a segfault that has escaped notice for many a release (related to
action indicators not being properly cleared before starting a new map)</li>
<li>fixed how you were able to detect traps while blinded</li>
<li>fixed a small memory leak (related to loading maps)</li>
<li>fixed a segfault caused by digging a wall right next to the map's outer
edge</li>
</ul></p>

<p><strong>compatability:</strong>
<ul>
<li>compatible with v.4a but <em>NOT</em> with any version &gt;=5</li>
</ul></p>

<p><strong>please note:</strong>
This is not a really &quot;shipped&quot; version anymore, nor is any besides the
latest in the main branch. <em>But</em>, you can still get this version by
checking out the correct git branch.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong><u>version 5</u></strong> released Mar 24, 2011</p>

<p><strong>Client:</strong>
<ul>
<li>changed the layout of the client screen; message area made wider, PC info

recorded)</li>
</ul></p>

<p><strong>changes affecting both C&amp;S:</strong>
<ul>
<li>new class: planewalker</li>
<li>following previous player (instead of just next); keybinding 'p'</li>
</ul></p>

<p><strong>other:</strong>
<ul>
<li>bots now also avoid known traps</li>
</ul></p>

<p><strong>compatability:</strong>
<ul>

compiling</li>
<li>bot name lengths in config were not checked; fixed this</li>

probably won't be updated any more in the 4x branch</li>

<hr>

<p><strong>version 4</strong> released Nov 11, 2010</p>

<p><strong>Client:</strong>
<ul>
<li>long chat messages are now split on several lines</li>
<li>chat typing revamped/fixed; you can now type long passages and actually see
what you're typing</li>
<li>a &quot;third colour mode&quot; for terminals that have at least 88 colours
but don't allow redefining their RGB values</li>
<li><font color="red">known issue:</font> unknown territory does not show
correctly in <em>st</em> (simple terminal), but this strikes me as a bizarre bug
in <em>st</em> (try playing around with 'testes/scenecol.cpp', using <em>st</em>
and/or another terminal with 'export TERM=st-256color' and see for
yourself)</li>
</ul></p>

<p><strong>Server:</strong>

though)</li>
</ul></p>

<p><strong>compatability:</strong>
<ul>
<li>fully compatible with v.3 in all respects</li>
<li>new server.conf template for 'botnames'</li>
</ul></p>

<hr>

<p><strong>version 3</strong> released Nov 3, 2010</p>

<p><strong>Client:</strong>
<ul>
<li>the &quot;ouch feature&quot; which allows automatic shout generation (with
custom message) when the PC is damaged</li>
<li>in the same vein, &quot;quick shouts&quot;: predefined messages that are
sent upon hitting the keys F1&mdash;F12</li>
<li>players can now review their key mappings with the fixed key '?'.
Consequently, no key can be remapped to '?'</li>
<li>repeated chat messages are now stored only once in the history</li>
<li>invalid original ctrl keybindings (^X) are now printed correctly in the
error message</li>
<li><font color="red">known issue:</font> too long chat messages are not printed
correctly</li>
</ul></p>

<p><strong>Server:</strong>
<ul>
<li>fixed the crash caused by a player joining a team and going back into
spectating before spawning (have a feeling I've fixed this same issue at least
three times...)</li>
<li>maps can now be stored&amp;reloaded, and stored maps can be listed; new
&quot;mapdir&quot; entry in server.conf</li>
<li>improvements to the &quot;map generation testing&quot; build: it is now
minimal (without all the other server functionality even present in the binary)
and can also store a map into a file</li>
<li>fixed a very stupid mistake due to which traps left by trappers were not
linked to their planter</li>
<li>trappers can disarm traps</li>
<li>zaps now die off if they travel for too long without bouncing (no more lucky
sniping from the other side of the map)</li>
<li>introduced undiggable walls</li>
<li>revamped house generation &mdash; from 550+ lines of code to 227 lines, yet
the houses are now more varied!</li>
<li>when a player switches team or joins a team after being a spectator, their
memory of the current map is cleared. Every non-spectator's map memory is
cleared when the teams are shuffled</li>
<li>can determine map type (dungeon/outdoor) in config similarly as game mode;
the value of this option also added to output of &quot;!serverinfo&quot;</li>
<li>a big revamp of the whole bot handling; end-user functionality is
essentially the same but many delicate problems were fixed</li>
<li>fixed a stupid mistake that allowed giving too high player-IDs (ultimately
making it impossible to connect to the server)</li>
<li>changed some wordings in some log messages about the config being
wrong</li>
<li><font color="red">known issue:</font> in principle the <em>!serverinfo</em>
replies can exceed the message length limit; this is not checked</li>
</ul></p>

<p><strong>other:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Mr. Brown updated (still doesn't <em>do</em> much of anything)</li>
<li><em>Katharsis!</em> Got rid of <em>auto*hell</em></li>
</ul></p>

<p><strong>compatability:</strong>

CPU</li>
<li>fixed parsing of IPv6 addresses (never tested!)</li>

wrong server)</li>
<li>can now give server address directly as a command line argument</li>
<li>any message sent by the server as a response to a connection attempt was
shown too briefly to be read; fixed this</li>

version&quot;)</li>
</ul></p>

<p><strong>Server:</strong>
<ul>
<li>system to automatically compile a &quot;server&quot; to test map generation
only</li>
<li>fixed a very stupid mistake that made all the maps seem stretched in the
NW&ndash;SE direction</li>
<li>adjustment of the 'h' parameter and the thresholds in outdoor map generation
(actual effects are many and difficult to explain)</li>
<li>an extensive revamp of the dungeon map generation</li>

one space and nothing else after the command)</li>

X&quot;, &quot;!nextmap X&quot;); just the actual saving and loading is yet to
be done...</li>
<li>Players who are kicked or banned now receive a message stating this</li>
<li>fireballs light carried torches (of any survivors who have a torch)</li>
<li>made swimming way more difficult (the way it was <em>supposed</em> to be, so
actually this was a bug fix)</li>
<li>print an ASCII &quot;logo&quot; at startup, and a message about graceful
shutdown (in stdout, not just in log)</li>
<li>don't print non-error log messages when running with
&quot;--pstats&quot;</li>

experimentation)</li>

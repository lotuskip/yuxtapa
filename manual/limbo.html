<h2>Limbo and spawning</h2>

<p>Initially, when you succesfully connect to a server, you will be a
spectator (see <a href="spectating.html">Spectating</a>). To actually start playing, you must
pick yourself a class (see <a href="classov.html">Class overview</a>) and join a team. This
happens through the <em>limbo menu</em>.</p>

<h3>The limbo menu</h3>
<p>The default key to view the limbo menu is 'l'. Note that the limbo
menu covers your view of the game (see <a href="clientscreen.html">Client view</a>), but the
game, being multiplayer, of course, is not paused. Here is a screenshot
of the limbo menu:<br>

<p>The keybindings inside the limbo menu are fixed; you cannot reconfigure
them. No distinction is made between upper and lower case letters.</p>

<p>The keys a-j (or A-J) are used (1) to join a team, or (2) to change your
class when you're already on a team. Each key corresponds to one class,
as listed in the limbo menu. Notes:
<ul>
<li>You automatically join the team that has less players, or the <em>green</em>
team if both teams have the same number</li>
<li>The server might restrict the number of PCs of the same class (see
<a href="serverconf.html">Server configuration</a>) and might tell you that a particular class
is not available at this time</li>
<li>If you change your class while playing, the change takes effect at the next
spawning; commit suicide if you want to change immediately</li>
</ul></p>

<p>The key 't' (or 'T') switches your team. It has no effect if you are
spectating. If the server has team balance activated, a team change that
causes the teams to be unbalanced will not be allowed. Notes:
<ul>
<li>If you are alive, switcing team causes you to die (but no death is recorded in the <a href="statistics.html">statistics</a>)</li>
<li>By default, you won't change your class when you switch team; however,
if there are no slots available for that class in the other team, the server
will assign you another class</li>
</ul></p>

<p>You can press 's' (or 'S') to leave the game and become a spectator. This
causes you to commit suicide if you are alive. If you are already spectating,
this makes you a free spectator (see <a href="spectating.html">Spectating</a>).</p>

<p>Press 'l' (or 'L') to exit the limbo menu and see the game view again.</p>

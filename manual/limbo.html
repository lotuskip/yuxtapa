<h2>Limbo and spawning</h2>

<p>Initially, when you succesfully connect to a server, you will be a
spectator (see <a href="spectating.html">Spectating</a>). To actually start playing, you must
pick yourself a class (see <a href="classov.html">Class overview</a>) and join a team. This
happens through the <em>limbo menu</em>.</p>

<h3>The limbo menu</h3>
<p>The default key to view the limbo menu is 'l'. Note that the limbo
menu covers your view of the game (see <a href="clientscreen.html">Client view</a>), but the
game, being multiplayer, of course, is not paused. Here is a screenshot
of the limbo menu:<br>

<p>The keybindings inside the limbo menu are fixed; you cannot reconfigure
them. No distinction is made between upper and lower case letters.</p>

<p>The keys a-j (or A-J) are used (1) to join a team, or (2) to change your
class when you're already on a team. Each key corresponds to one class,
as listed in the limbo menu. Notes:
<ul>
<li>You automatically join the team that has less players, or the <em>green</em>
team if both teams have the same number</li>
<li>The server might restrict the number of PCs of the same class (see
<a href="serverconf.html">Server configuration</a>) and might tell you that a particular class
is not available at this time</li>
<li>If you change your class while playing, the change takes effect at the next
spawning; commit suicide if you want to change immediately</li>
</ul></p>

<p>The key 't' (or 'T') switches your team. It has no effect if you are
spectating. If the server has team balance activated, a team change that
causes the teams to be unbalanced will not be allowed. Notes:
<ul>
<li>If you are alive, switcing team causes you to die (but no death is recorded in the <a href="statistics.html">statistics</a>)</li>
<li>By default, you won't change your class when you switch team; however,
if there are no slots available for that class in the other team, the server
will assign you another class</li>
</ul></p>

<p>You can press 's' (or 'S') to leave the game and become a spectator. This
causes you to commit suicide if you are alive. If you are already spectating,
this makes you a free spectator (see <a href="spectating.html">Spectating</a>).</p>

<p>Press 'l' (or 'L') to exit the limbo menu and see the game view again.</p>


<h3>Spawning</h3>
<p>Both teams have a spawning moment at regular intervals. The green team spawn
happens at the middle point between two purple spawns, and vice versa. The players
only see the time in seconds to their team's next spawn (see
<a href="clientscreen.html">Client screen</a>).</p>

<p>When the spawn moment is reached, all currently dead players in that team
are respawned: they have full hitpoints and all hindered effects such as being poisoned
or having a rusty weapon are removed.</p>

<p>Spawning happens at the most recently captured flag (on flags, see <a href="gametypes.html">Game types</a>),
but only nine PCs at a time are spawned at a single flag. They appear somewhere in the vicinity of the flag,
as close to it as possible. If more than 9 players need to be spawned,
the rest will spawn at the <em>next most recently</em> captured flag, and so on until there are no more flags
unused, at which point any remaining PCs are spawned at the first flag again.</p>

<p>It is generally forbidden to stalk near an enemy flag in order to easily kill newly
spawned enemies. This behaviour is called <em>spawn killing</em> (SK). Either capture the enemy
flag, or, if you can't, move away from it. If you happen to be close by when enemy spawning occurs,
refrain from attacking immediately. If spawn killing for some reason is accepted on
the server, this should be clearly stated somewhere.</p>

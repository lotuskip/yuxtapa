<h2>Client configuration</h2>

<p>
The yuxtapa client configuration, like the <a href="serverconf.html">Server configuration</a>, is
typically in the file
<blockquote>/home/username/.config/yuxtapa/client.conf</blockquote>
It is first looked for in '$XGD_CONFIG_HOME/yuxtapa/', and secondarily, if
XGD_CONFIG_HOME is not defined, in '$HOME/.config/yuxtapa/'. You should
create this directory and copy the file 'tmplates/client.conf' there.</p>

<p>You can edit the file with your favourite text editor.
The config is read one line at a time. A line beginning with a '#' is
a comment and is skipped. Empty lines are skipped, too.</p>

<p>A valid entry starts with a keyword, one of the following: <strong>nick</strong>,
<strong>server</strong>, <strong>key</strong>, <strong>anim</strong>, <strong>alias</strong>. These are explained below.</p>

<p>
<pre>nick mynick</pre>
sets your nick (username, by which you are known when you play) to 'mynick'.
It can be any string, but at most 10 characters long. (Yes, that's not much.)
If no nick is provided or the config file is missing, the default nick
'player' will be used. Try to be more original.</p>

<p>
<pre>anim ABCD</pre>
sets the <em>update animation</em> (see <a href="clientscreen.html">Client screen</a>). It can be anything
you like, but at least 2 and at most 15 symbols. The default is '-\|/', which
then appears as a 'turning stick'.</p>

<p>
The <strong>nick</strong> and <strong>anim</strong> are <em>overwriting</em> settings. That means that if they
are given more than once in the config, only the last value is effective. That is, if
your config says
<pre>
nick Allan
nick Joe
key Q}
nick Thomas
</pre>
yout nick will be 'Thomas' (and the values 'Allan' and 'Joe' are simply discarded).
</p>

<h3>Aliases</h3>
<p>
<pre>alias xyz much longer outcome</pre>
will make 'xyz' a short alias for 'much longer outcome'. The effect of this
is that whenever you say 'xyz' (in the chat or out loud, see <a href="chatting.html">Chatting and shouting</a>),
it is automatically expanded into 'much longer outcome' before sending to the
server. The expanded string could be something you find yourself saying often,
or a server command you often use.</p>

<h3>Servers</h3>
<p>
<pre>server 123.123.123.123:4444 MyFaveServ</pre>
stores a server, with the IP 123.123.123.123 and port 4444 under the name
'MyFaveServ', and defines this as a known server. Now you can connect to
this server by running the client with its name as an argument:
<blockquote>yuxtapa MyFaveServ</blockquote>
and the client will connect to MyFaveServ, i.e. 123.123.123.123:4444.</p>

<p>You can store as many servers as you want in the config; just put each
on a separate line. The <em>first</em> server in the file is the <strong>default
server</strong>. That's where the client connects if you don't give it any
argument.</p>

<p>If there are no servers in the config file, the client will only know
about <em>localhost</em> (a server running on the same computer) and connect
there. If localhost (127.0.0.1:???? or the IPv6 equivalent) <em>is</em> one of
the servers you use, you must explicitly specify it in the config.</p>

<p>yuxtapa should be able to handle both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.</p>

<h3>How to find servers?</h3>
<p>Good question! If you have bandwidth to spare and feel like putting up your
own permanent server, please do so and post your IP and port on the <a href="serverlist.html">Server list</a>!
That list is also the best place to start looking for a place to play. You
can, obviously, also organise a play-together with some friends; just have
one of you run the server and inform the others of the server's IP.</p>


<h3>Key remapping</h3>
<p>
<pre>key XY</pre>
remaps the default key 'X' to the key 'Y'. That is, if you press 'Y', the
client will suicide (as 'X' is the default key to suicide). See the default
<a href="keybindings.html">Key bindings</a> for a complete list.</p>

<p>The <em>key</em> setting is an overwriting one as well, and moreover it overwrites
as the config file is processed. Suppose you have in your config
<pre>
key Xa
key Xb
key ab
</pre>
Now the first line maps 'X' to 'a'. This is fine. But the second line will give
an error, since 'X' is no longer a known key (it's been remapped to 'a'). The
thirds line, however, is fine, and remaps the suicide key to 'b'.</p>

<p>Conflicts (two functions mapped to the same key) are not tolerated, and if any
appear, the client reverts back to the default keys.</p>

<p>Note that you can only remap to ASCII keys, not for instance to the function keys
F1 through F12, or to CTRL or Alt etc. Just to the keys you can type into the
config file as characters.</p>

<h2>Client configuration</h2>

<p>A template configuration file is contained in the yuxtapa tarball; it is under the
directory 'yuxtapa/tmplates', and named '<strong>client.conf</strong>'. AUR users will find this file
in '/usr/share/yuxtapa/' after installing.</p>

<p>This configuration file, when in use, typically resides under
<blockquote>/home/username/.config/yuxtapa/</blockquote>
It is looked for in in '$HOME/.config/yuxtapa/'. <strong>You should
create this directory and copy the template file 'client.conf' there.</strong></p>

<p>You can edit the file with your favourite text editor. The provided template
should be commented to be self-explanatory, see it.</p>

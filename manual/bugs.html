<h2>Sending bug reports</h2>

<p>Bug reports can be sent via email to onnir <em>at sign</em> iki <em>dot</em> fi,
or in any other way you can think of to reach the author (forum threads and PMs spring to mind).</p>

<p>
Some guidelines for constructing bug reports:
<ul>
<li>Make sure you are running the latest version of the game; otherwise what you report might already be fixed or irrelevant</li>
<li>If you are not quite sure it's a bug you've found, ask around the forums/IRC before submitting a report</li>
<li>Check the list of known issues at the bottom of this page, and the <a href="qa.html">Q&amp;A section</a></li>
<li>What some people seem to consider bugs are merely <em>counterintuitive features</em>, eg.:</li>
<ul>
<li>Yes, I know that in the game arrows fly only 3 times as fast as people run; it's a game, not a real-life simulation!</li>
<li>Yes, you instantly know in which part of the map you are even after being randomly teleported</li>
</ul>
<li>Provide information that you think is relevant. This could be:</li>
<ul>
<li>config files</li>
<li>server log</li>
<li>screenshots (if you really need to <em>show</em> something; most things can be explained)</li>
<li>messages printed by the game (especially if the game crashed)</li>
</ul>
<li>But most importantly, <em>always</em> provide a good description:</li>
<ul>
<li>a general description of the situation where the problem occured</li>
<li>better to include everything you can think of than to omit something as 'seemingly irrelevant'</li>
<li>always mention if you know a definite way of reproducing the bug</li>
</ul>
</ul></p>


<h3>Known bugs</h3>

<p>There are some known 'bugs' (or <em>odd features</em>) that won't be fixed even though they could. The reasons can be many, e.g.:
<ul>
<li>it would be a lot of trouble</li>
<li>it would require a large renovation of the code</li>
<li>it would pose a significant efficiency/tidyness drop for only a minor benefit</li>
<li>the issue doesn't really distract normal gameplay as it is</li>
</ul></p>

<p><em><u>Delayed updating of destroyed things</u></em><br>
There are generally a number of situations where the view won't update even though
it ought to in order to keep the client up to date. The usual reason is that a player disconnects
and all the entities she owns are destroyed, but they will linger in the views of other
players until something else forces the view to update. Another typical case is a corpse that
has in truth rotten away but still lingers in view. <em>Movement</em> always forces
the view to update, so if you take a step, you can be sure that what you see is an up-to-date
representation of the situation right after you took the step.</p>

<p><em><u>The 'but there are no animations!' bug</u></em><br>
Some people might think it a bug/limitation/problem that you only see snapshots of an arrow flying, for instance. That is, you only see the
arrow there every 3 tiles instead of seeing it smoothly fly one tile at a time. But <em>that is how it is!</em> There are
no 'animations'! See <a href="timesystem.html">Time system</a>.</p>

<p><em><u>The 'wall dust' bug</u></em><br>
If a wall is dug out, and the tile that is uncovered is lit, you will not see that
tile until you're close enough to see it even if it was not lit.
If this bothers you, just think about it like this: after a wall is dug out, a
cloud of dust remains behind, making it difficult to see. On the other hand, if you
didn't even understand the bug by the preceding explanation, then surely it hasn't
bothered you!<br>
[In more technical terms: the viewpoints' lit-flags are not updated immediately when the lit-flags in the map are.]</p>

<p><em><u>The 'thin walls have many holes' bug</u></em><br>
If there is a thin wall (one tile wide) and a light source on the other side, you
see the wall as lit even when standing on the dark side:
<pre>
           wall
         ...#...
torch--&gt; .t.#..@ &lt;-- this PC sees the wall as lit
         ...#...
tile lit:1111000
</pre>
This can be 'explained' by stating that thin walls have small holes in them: you
really see the torch light shining through.<br>
[The technical explanation is that being lit is just a boolean; there is no direction attached.]</p>


<p><em><u>Classlimitless shuffling</u></em><br>
After a team shuffle the classes
of the PCs aren't checked, so the <em>classlimit setting</em> (see the server configuration file 'server.conf')
might be violated. You still can't change your class into any 'fully taken' class, but you can
retain your own 'fully taken' class as long as you wish.
The problem here is partly about fairness: some players could be forced to switch their class,
but just picking those players at random seems like an unnecessary annoyance to the players. Then
again, if a team wants to do well, they will need a variety of classes, so it can be expected that
good players switch class after a shuffle if they see the need.</p>

<p><em><u>Phantom aiming</u></em><br>
If you are playing an archer and are alive when a game ends, it is possible to
&quot;aim&quot; with your bow both during the intermission and, if you are in
the green team, before spawning in the next map. This is because the server
doesn't bother to inform all clients that they are no longer active. If you
actually fire your bow, the server will react to this and let your client know
that you are no longer alive.</p>

<p><em><u>Portal sounds are off</u></em><br>
When entering a portal, the sound effect is shown at the position where the PC
entered the portal from, not on the portal. This is not exactly intentional, but
it's been decided that it's okay. In fact in can be more informative this way, if there
happened to be several PCs standing around the portal.</p>

<p><em><u>No corpses on traps</u></em><br>
If a PC dies to any trap, or is killed while standing on a trap, no corpse is
generated. This is because, for simplicity, the game just doesn't allow both
a corpse and a trap in the same spot.</p>

<p><em><u>Unsymmetric torch carrying</u></em><br>
When walking next to a long wall with a lit torch you might notice that in one
direction more wall is lit than in the other direction. Technically this is
because the dynamic lighting algorithm uses a simplified LOS logic, which
suffers from the fact that Bresenham's algorithm is not symmetrical. In reality
this is explained by the PCs carrying the torch funnily, resulting in the
observed effect.</p>

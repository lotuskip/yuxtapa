<h2>Rule mechanics</h2>

<p>This page is in no particular order, and contains no <em>necessary</em>
information. Read only if truly interested.</p>

<p>If you are unfamiliar with the <em>d</em>-notation, e.g. <em>1d6+1</em>, this means: roll a 6-sided die and
add 1 to the result, or in other words, generate an evenly distributed random number between 1 and 7. <em>2d8-2</em> would
mean: roll two 8-sided dice, sum the results and reduce 2, or, a random number between 0 and 14 (this time not quite evenly distributed!).</p>

<h3>Tohit, PV, and DV</h3>

<p>Determining whether an attack hits:<br>
Let P := [target's DV] - [attacker's tohit].<br>
Let R := 1d20-1 (random number 0..19).<br>
If R &gt;= P or R==19, the attack hits.<br>
If R/P (integer division) &gt;= 2 or R==19, the hit is <em>critical</em>.</p>

<p>Next, roll the damage defined for the attack (see <a href="classov.html">Class overview</a>).
Unless the hit was critical, reduce the defender's PV. This is the amount
of damage dealt; reduce it from the defender's hitpoints.</p>

<p>
The above applies to all melee attacks, shooting arrows, <a href="fighter.html">fighters'</a>
circular attacks, and booby traps.
<ul>
<li>archery: damage 1d6, tohit +7</li>
<li>circular attack: damage 1d8, tohit +5 (hit tested separately for each target)</li>
<li>booby-trap: damage 2d6, tohit +9</li>
<li>assassins when hiding: damage is 'doubled', 2d4+4</li>
</ul>
Archery damage and tohit are not affect by rusting (caused by <a href="traps.html">water traps</a>).</p>

<p>To give some idea: the highest probability to hit, when an assassin attacks a wizard, is 95% (with a 90% chance of a critical hit,
but that makes no difference since wizards have 0 PV). The lowest probability to hit, when a healer attacks an assassin, is
5% (and a hit is always critical, again meaninglessly in this case since assassins also have 0 PV).
All other combinations reside somewhere in between. For instance, a fighter attacking a fighter (regular melee attacks):
55% chance to hit, 10% chance of a critical. Since a fighter has PV 5, 37.5% of non-critical hits deal no damage in this case.</p>


<h3>Spells and magic resistance</h3>

<p>Spells always hit and bypass armour (DV/PV play no role). Damage for a magic missile is 1d5.
Damage for a zap is 2d5, rolled separately for each hit.</p>

<p>However, with magic resistance it is possible to avoid the effect of a spell. The resistance
given in <a href="classov.html">Class overview</a> is the chance in percents of this happening.
With magic resistance you can resist:
<ul>
<li>magic missiles (the missile hits you but deals no damage)</li>
<li>zaps (the zap hits you or passes through you but deals no damage)</li>
<li>teleportation <a href="traps.html">traps</a> (you simply do not teleport; here the resistance can kick in even if you <em>intentionally</em>
trigger the trap to make yourself teleport!)</li>
</ul></p>


<h3>Swimming and Drowning</h3>

<p>When you enter a water square (by walking there, by switching places with
someone there, or by blinking there), you will lose the next two turns.</p>

<p>Drowning damage is dealt if, at the end of any given turn, you are in water
and are not losing any turns. The damage amount is random, between 1 and 3 points.</p>

<p>To avoid drowning, you must move out of the water (possibly to another water square,
but it doesn't matter) precisely at that turn on which you would take the
first drowning damage. On normal timing settings this means that you must move
two steps per second, no more, no less. Attempting to move faster means you rush and
don't swim properly, while moving too slowly means you don't swim enough and thus sink.</p>

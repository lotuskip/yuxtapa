<h2>Getting and installing</h2>

<p><strong>If you just want to try the game out real quick</strong>, the necessary steps are:
<ul>
<li>Download the source code tarball and extract it</li>
<li>Compile the server and the client as explained below</li>
<li>Create the directory ~/.config/yuxtapa</li>
<li>Copy the configuration template files server.conf and client.conf from 'yuxtapa/tmplates/' there</li>
<li>Run the server (yuxtapa_sv), leave it running</li>
<li>In another terminal run the client (yuxtapa_cl); you're then playing solo on your own local server</lI>
</ul></p>
<p>More precise instructions follow.</p>


<h3>Downloading</h3>
<p>You have one or two options:
<ul>
<li>Download the yuxtapa source code (from <a
href="http://github.com/lotuskip/yuxtapa/">github</a>) to compile it manually</li>
<li>If you are an Arch Linux user, just search for yuxtapa in the <a href="http://aur.archlinux.org">AUR</a></li>
</ul>
Contributions such as RPMs are welcome, and will be made available (or linked) if received.</p>


<h3>Requirements</h3>
<p>Here is a list of what libraries you need in order to build yuxtapa. Refer to the documentation of your Linux distribution
to find out how to install them.
<ul>
<li>NCurses (typically called <em>ncurses</em> or <em>libncurses</em>)</li>
<li>ZLib (<em>zlib</em>)</li>
</ul>
If your distribution makes the distinction, these need to be the
<em>development</em> versions (eg. <em>ncurses-devel</em>, <em>zlib-devel</em>).</p>

<p>Please see the <a href="terminals.html">Terminals</a> page for information about what the yuxtapa
client requires from the terminal emulator.</p>


<h3>Compiling the source</h3>

<p>yuxtapa has a separate executable for the server and the client. You can compile either or both.
The AUR package installs both by default. Users of AUR know what to do. The following is for everybody else.</p>

<p>To build either only the client or only the server, run (in the directory 'yuxtapa' that is created upon
extracting the source package) either of
<pre>
make client
</pre>
and
<pre>
make server
</pre>
respectively. Just 'make' compiles both. The client is called 'yuxtapa_cl' and the server 'yuxtapa_sv'. Both
will be placed in the 'yuxtapa' directory.</p>


<h3>Grabbing anything else you need from the package</h3>
<p>There is no install script or Makefile rule: to &quot;install&quot; the game into your system, you
must do something like
<pre>
mv yuxtapa_cl yuxtapa_sv /usr/bin
</pre>
as root. There are no other &quot;system files&quot; beyond these two executables.</p>

<p>The source tarball contains other stuff that might be of interest to users, as well.
Such as this manual (AUR users will have it installed in /usr/share/doc/yuxtapa/),
the bot client (see the file 'testes/README' as well as the <a href="bots.html">manual page on bots</a>), and
the template configuration files (see below).</p>


<h3>Configuring and running</h3>
<p>In order to get playing, you must <a href="clientconf.html">configure the client</a>. After
that is done, you can run the client program with
<pre>yuxtapa_cl</pre>
if you installed the executable into your path, or with
<pre>./yuxtapa_cl</pre>
in the directory containing the executable otherwise.</p>

<p>Some notes about setting up a server are in the <a href="serverconf.html">server configuration</a> page.</p>


<h3>On other platforms</h3>

<p>The yuxtapa client has been succesfully compiled on OSX (10.6), and with some work the server <em>should</em>
compile, too. OSX is not actually <em>supported</em>, though, so if you want to compile yuxtapa on your OSX, be prepared
to modify the Makefile and possibly even some source code.</p>

<p>Some points you might find useful on OSX:
<ul>
<li>you will need a gcc style compiler installed; consider using MacPorts</li>
<li>zlib and ncurses <em>should</em> be present by default; if not, make them available</li>
<li>add '-D_XOPEN_SOURCE_EXTENDED' to the Makefile CPPFLAGS (this appeared to be required to include wide character
support in ncurses)</li>
<li>as mentioned, the client has been compiled succesfully; the server code might require minor modifications to compile</li>
</ul></p>

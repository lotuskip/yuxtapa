<h2>Getting and installing</h2>

<h3>Downloading</h3>
<p>You have one or two options:
<ul>
<li>Download the yuxtapa source code (link on the <a href="http://tempoanon.net/lotuskip/yuxtapa/">homepage</a>) and compile it yourself</li>
<li>If you are an Arch Linux user, just search for yuxtapa in the <a href="http://aur.archlinux.org">AUR</a></li>
</ul></p>


<h3>Requirements</h3>
<p>Here is a list of what libraries you need to build yuxtapa. Refer to the documentation of your Linux distribution
to find out how to install them.
<ul>
<li>NCurses (typically called <em>ncurses</em> or <em>libncurses</em>)</li>
<li>C++ boost (<em>boost</em>)</li>
<li>ZLib (<em>zlib</em>)</li>
</ul>
You will also need a sane C++ compiling environment full with the GNU <em>autotools</em>.</p>

<p>Please see the <a href="terminals.html">Terminals</a> page for information about what yuxtapa
requires from the terminal emulator.</p>


<h3>Compiling the source</h3>
<p>yuxtapa has a separate executable for the server and the client. You can compile either or both.
Furthermore, you can compile with debug either enabled or disabled. (Debug being enabled
results in a larger binary and perhaps a tiny performance drop.) <em>By default</em> both the server and the client are built, and
debugging is disabled.</p>

<p><em>If you use AUR</em>, these defaults are followed (but perhaps you know enough to change that). The following instructions
are intended for people not using AUR:</p>

<p>First extract the source package. Then, in a terminal, in the created directory 'yuxtapa-XX', where XX is a version number, run
the autools:
<pre>
autoconf
automake
</pre>
These shouldn't print anything if everything goes smoothly. Next, run configure (one of the following, for instance):
<pre>
./configure                                   [default: client + server, no debug]
./configure --enable-debug                    [client + server, with debug]
./configure --disable-client                  [just the server, no debug]
./configure --enable-debug --disable-server   [just the client, with debug]
</pre>
etc., you get the idea. If that runs okay without complaints, you can continue with
<pre>
make
</pre>
to compile and, optionally,
<pre>
make install
</pre>
as root to install. Installing is not necessary to play or to run a server.
</p>

<h3>Configuring and running</h3>
<p>Next, in order to get playing, you must <a href="clientconf.html">configure the client</a>. After
that is done, you can run the client program with
<pre>yuxtapa_cl</pre>
if you installed the game, or
<pre>./yuxtapa_cl</pre>
in the directory containing the executable otherwise.</p>

<h2>Chatting and shouting</h2>
<p>Hitting the tabulator and <strong>s</strong> (these are the defaults) put you in <em>typing mode</em> where
you can type something to say; hit enter to say it, or one of <em>escape</em>, <em>tab</em>, and <em>^C</em> to cancel (hitting
enter when you haven't typed anything also cancels, so you won't 'say nothing'.)</p>

<p>The difference between these commands is that <em>shouting</em> is an 'in-game'
feature while <em>chatting</em> is considered 'off-game'. Every connected player
sees what you say in the chat. But when you shout, it's not <em>you</em> who
shouts but your character! Only the players whose characters are close enough
to your character will see what you say. This includes spectators. Shouting
also triggers a sound event, see <a href="vision.html">Vision and hearing</a>. If a PC shouts
in your line of sight, her '@' is replaced by a '!' for one turn. A message containing
the text of the shout is sent to all nearby viewers.</p>

<p>On occasion, shouts are generated automatically. The server generates a shout if a PC
falls into a chasm. The players can define (in the <a href="clientconf.html">client configuration</a>)
an automatic shout that is generated if they take damage. This can be very useful for warning
nearby teammates, for instance.</p>

<p>Players can also (again, in the client configuration) define <em>quick shouts</em> that they
can utter without typing by just pressing one of the function keys F1&mdash;F12.</p>


<h3>Chat commands</h3>

<p>The chat can also be used to send certain commands and requests to the server.
These always start with an exclamation mark. It is possible for the server admin
to disable any of these commands in the <a href="serverconf.html">server configuration</a>.</p>

<p>Usable by anyone, anytime (if not disabled):
<ul>
<li><strong>!serverinfo</strong> prints information about the settings of the server into the chat</li>
<li><strong>!adminlvl [nick]</strong> prints the <a href="adminlevels.html">admin level</a> (AL) of the player with the specified nick</li>
<li><strong>!teams</strong> returns a message containing a listing of the current teams</li>
<li><strong>!lscmd</strong> prints the supported commands (only those that are not disabled)</li>
</ul></p>

<p>Requiring <a href="adminlevels.html">AL</a> at least 2:
<ul>
<li><strong>!shuffle</strong> shuffles the teams, see <a href="teambalance.html">Team balance</a></li>
<li><strong>!nextmap [name]</strong>:
<ul>
<li>without <em>name</em> generates a random map and forces an <a href="intermission.html">Intermission</a>, or, if on one, forces it to end
<li>if <em>name</em> is given, tries to load a map by that name (see <a href="mapsaving.html">map saving</a>). If successful, regardless of current game
state, loads that map and starts an intermission. If no map by such name could be loaded, generates a random map instead</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>!listmaps</strong> returns a list of previously saved maps</li>
<li><strong>!plinfo [nick]</strong> returns the specified player's IP, total time played, and mentions if they are a bot</li>
<li><strong>!howfair</strong> makes an estimate at how &quot;fair&quot; (even/uneven) the teams are. The result is a number between -50 and +50; the
higher the number, the more dominant the <em>green</em> team is (teams are even if the number is close to 0). The computation is based on the same
data as the team shuffling, so to get reasonable results you should have sufficient statistics on each player</li>
</ul></p>

<p>Requiring AL at least 3:
<ul>
<li><strong>!storemap [name]</strong> saves the current map; see <a href="mapsaving.html">map saving</a></li>
<li><strong>!log [text]</strong> add <em>text</em> to the <a href="serverlog.html">server log</a> file</li>
<li><strong>!clearbans</strong> removes all bans (otherwise they remain until server restart)</li>
<li><strong>!spawnbots [num]</strong> spawn num-many <a href="bots.html">Bots</a>; must be a single digit, so at most 9 at a time</li>
<li><strong>!dropbots</strong> remove all bots (individual bots can of course be '!kick'ed, too)</li>
<li><strong>!teambal [o/a/p]</strong> sets the <a href="teambalance.html">Team balance</a> option ([o]ff, [a]ctive, [p]assive)</li>
<li><strong>!servermsg [new server greeting]</strong> sets the server greeting string</li>
</ul>
The last two commands only affect a session; they do not overwrite the settings in the <a href="serverconf.html">Server configuration</a>.</p>

<p>Requiring AL higher than the target's:
<ul>
<li><strong>!kick [nick]</strong> kicks a player off of the server</li>
<li><strong>!mute [nick]</strong> prevents the chat messages of a player from showing (not just to the issuer but to anyone)</li>
<li><strong>!unmute [nick]</strong> remove a mute</li>
<li><strong>!setal [nick] [value]</strong> sets a player's AL</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>Requiring AL at least 3 and higher than the target's:
<ul>
<li><strong>!ban [nick]</strong> kicks a player and bans their IP</li>
<li><strong>!putteam [nick] [g/p/s]</strong> forces another player to switch team or go to spectator (note: you cannot use this to force a player
to <em>join</em> a team; use <em>!setclass</em> instead)</li>
<li><strong>!setclass [nick] [class abbr.]</strong> sets another player's next class. This can be used to make a spectator join a
team. The class abbreviations are given in the <a href="classov.html">class overview</a>. Note that the player's PC is not killed if still alive</li>
</ul></p>

<p>In all the commands that contain [nick], you can use a partial nick. For instance, if there is an 'anonymous' playing
and you issue '!kick ano', and there is no other player with 'ano' in their name, 'anonymous' gets kicked.</p>

<p>The following commands, and only the following, can be used when muted (as using them will be completely invisible to other players): !adminlvl,
!teams, !log, and !plinfo.</p>

<p>Note that banning really bans the entire IP. This can have an undesired side-effect of banning a whole
subnet of people when one player from that IP gets a ban. Also, if you ban bots, that
bans the local IP making further spawning of bots impossible.</p>

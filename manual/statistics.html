<h2>Statistics</h2>

<p>The server keeps various statistics on the performance of all the players.
Normally these are 'hidden' in the servers memory, not visible to the
players themselves, but they can be published by the server administrator.
If you start the server with the extra command line argument '<strong>--pstats</strong>',
the server will print to stdout all player statistics and exit.</p>

<p>The stats are supposed to be human-readable to some extent, but in particular
easily analysable/representable with self-made scripts or programs.</p>


<h3>The statistics table</h3>

<p>For each player, the following information is included:
<ul>
<li>most recent nick</li>
<li>time information:
<ul>
<li>last seen (date and time)</li>
<li>total time spent connected to the server (h:min:s), minus intermissions</li>
<li>percentage of that spent spectating</li>
<li>percentage of that spent playing as each class (if non-zero)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>performance information:
<ul>
<li>kills, per each separate way of killing (if not zero), and grand total</li>
<li>team kills, grand total</li>
<li>deaths, grand total</li>
<li>total healing received in hitpoints (includes self-healing)</li>
<li>archery accuracy-%</li>
<li>combat magic (zap) accuracy-% (since zaps can hit several times their accuracy can exceed 100%)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></p>

<p>Hitting teammates does not count as hitting in the accuracy considerations. With archery, it is considered a hit if your
arrow stops at a square where there is an opponent, even if the actual result is a 'miss' after the to-hit/DV consideration.</p>

<p>
About the times, note that if the percentages don't quite add up to 100%, this is due to two reasons:
<ul>
<li>(main reason:) time spent dead, aka 'in the limbo' counts as time spent on the server but not as any of the listed percentages
<ul>
<li>this way it is possible to compare also how much time players 'waste being dead'</li>
</ul></li>
<li>rounding errors; all percentages are rounded down to integers, and all times are rounded down to full seconds</li>
</ul></p>

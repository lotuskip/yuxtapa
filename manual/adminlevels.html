<h2>Admin levels</h2>

<p>Every player on a server has an <em>admin level</em> (AL). The possible ALs are
<ul>
<li>0, <em>guest</em>, (G)</li>
<li>1, <em>regular</em>, (R)</li>
<li>2, <em>trusted user</em>, (TU)</li>
<li>3, <em>admin</em>, (A)</li>
<li>4, <em>super admin</em>, (SA)</li>
</ul></p>

<p>Every new player is initially a guest. There can be only one super admin on a server.</p>

<p>To check the AL of yourself or anyone else, you can use the <em>!adminlvl</em> command,
see <a href="chatting.html">Chatting and shouting</a>. All the ALs of all connected players are also
automatically displayed during intermission.</p>


<h3>The Super Admin</h3>

<p>To become the super admin, you must be the first player to connect to the server,
and execute the command
<pre>
!setal [your-nick-here] 4
</pre>
This command (see <a href="chatting.html">Chatting and shouting</a>) sets the AL of a user. Usually
you can only change the AL of <em>other</em> users, but in the special case
that you are the first and only player on the server, you can make yourself the super
admin.</p>

<h3>Privileges</h3>

<p>Your AL determines what you are entitled to do on the server, or, what commands you
are allowed to execute. See <a hreg="chatting.html">Chatting and shouting</a> for the
list of the commands and their requirements.</p>

<p>You may only set the AL (<em>!setal</em>) of a player whose AL is currently
lower than yours, and you can set their AL at most to equal your own AL.
There can be only one super admin, though.</p>

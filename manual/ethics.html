<h2>Ethics</h2>

<p>This is a short listing of rules that every new player should
familiarize themselves with. General things about nice behaviour are not repeated
here &mdash; politeness, fairness, etc. should go without saying.
<ul>
<li>Keep in mind that this is a team game: play for the team</li>
<li>If you play a miner you're expected to dig passages when required; if you
play a healer you're expected to heal teammates at least when they request it;
etc.</li>
<li>Only change your team when the team balance requires it</li>
<li>In the same vein, do not go spectator in order to find out the layout of the
map or to spy on the other team</li>
<li>If you go away from your computer for longer than a few minutes, join the spectators</li>
<li>Do not flood the message window by shouting constantly. To determine what is
too much, imagine yourself <em>actually</em> uttering all the things you
shout</li>
<li>Do not spawn kill (SK) unless it's explicitly allowed on the server (see <a
href="limbo.html">spawning</a>)</li>
<li>Do your best not to team kill (TK). Watch it with those arrows and
spells</li>
<li>Do not <a href="cheating.html">cheat</a>, and help to catch cheaters</li>
</ul></p>

<h2>Technicalities</h2>

<p>This page is intended to answer some questions about the &quot;architecture&quot;, &quot;design principles&quot;, and &quot;layout&quot; of the yuxtapa
source code. (The quotation marks refer to lack in actuality.) So, unless you're a programmer who's interested in how yuxtapa works and too lazy to look at
the code, don't bother reading on.</p>

<p>In a certain sense, the yuxtapa client and server are very strictly separated. The client <em>only</em> reads player input and displays stuff on the
screen, without understanding much about what is going on. The server handles <em>all</em> in-game logic, and it even does the &quot;rendering&quot;.
(Imagine a 3D-shooter where the server renders a ready <em>picture</em> for each client for each frame...). In other words, the client doesn't know about
any &quot;objects in the game&quot;, it only receives a ready-made picture to display for the player.</p>

<p>There are certain reasons for this kind of design:
<ul>
<li>makes coding more simple; a change in the server rarely requires a change in the client and vice versa</li>
<li>makes many (but not all) forms of cheating literally impossible</li>
</ul></p>

<p>This pattern cannot feasibly be followed all that extremely. Ideally, the client wouldn't need to know about <em>any</em> game variables. But in
practice, it knows the PC's current class, for instance, so that it can directly allow the player to aim with her bow without asking the server first if this
is right or not.</p>


<h4>Dependencies, and reasons behind them</h4>

<p>The requirement of Ncurses should be obvious: we use it to display things on the client side.</p>

<p>C++ Boost is used for:
<ul>
<li>lexical casts (change interger 123 into string &quot;123&quot;); <em>could be removed</em></li>
<li>trimming strings of whitespaces; <em>could be removed</em></li>
<li>boost arrays, which are sort of nice; I haven't looked into how involved coding these myself would be</li>
</ul>
All and all, getting rid of boost-dependencies would be nice, but for now it remains required.</p>

<p>zlib is used to compress the &quot;rendered&quot; views the server sends to clients. I think this is smart. A view update is always over a KiB big, and
we might send up to 4 of them per second to each player, and there might be something like 50 players (that would be 200 packages per second). The
compression also doesn't seem to contribute much to the server's workload.</p>

<h4>About the bots</h4>

<p>To keep things, and in particular the server, simple and manageable, the bots are separate programs that from the server's point of view are almost like
any clients. This means that the bots do not have direct access to game data: they see only what the server sends them just like regular clients! While
perhaps unefficient in certain ways, this makes writing realistic AI much easier, and in particular the development of the AI is entirely separate from the
server code. It also, in principle, allows using remote bots: since the bot executable is separate from the server executable, it doesn't matter if it is
running on a separate machine. Most importantly, changes in the AI (where <em>most</em> changes in the future quite likely will take place) do not require
changing or recompiling the server.</p>

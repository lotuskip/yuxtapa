<h2>Archer</h2>

<p>pros: very high DV, very long LOS-radius, great ability</br>
cons: terrible melee attack, no magic resistance</p>


<h3>Abilities</h3>
<ul>
<li>Shooting arrows</li>
</ul>

<p>To shoot an arrow, first go into firing mode by pressing space. Your '@'
is replaced by an 'X'; this is the <em>aimer</em>.</p>

<p>Now you move the aimer with the numpad keys you usually use to walk around.
You can press '5' to return the aimer to your own position. Press space again
when the aimer is over your own position to cancel firing. If you press space when the aimer
is somewhere else, you will fire at that location.</p>

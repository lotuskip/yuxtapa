<h2>Ways to die</h2>

<p>'A' and 'B' are to be replaced with player nicks (A dies, B gets the kill).
Those marked with '(%)' leave a corpse.
<ul>
<li>'A was killed by B.' (%) (melee)</li>
<li>'A was shot by B.' (%) (arrows; B is an <a href="archer.html">Archer</a>)</li>
<li>'A was sliced in half by B.' (%) (circular attack; B is a <a href="fighter.html">Fighter</a>)</li>
<li>'A was zapped by B.' (%) (zap spell; B is/was a <a href="combatmage.html">Combat mage</a>)</li>
<li>'A failed to notice B's boobytrap.' (%) (temporary trap; B is/was a <a href="trapper.html">Trapper</a>)</li>
<li>'A died to a trap.' (%) (static boobytrap, not planted by anybody)</li>
<li>'A fried to a trap.' (a fireball trap)</li>
<li>'A was taken to the flames by B.' (B stepped on a fireball trap and the flames killed A, too)</li>
<li>'A could not outrun B's magic missile.' (%) (mms; B is/was a <a href="wizard.html">Wizard</a>)</li>
<li>'A was backstabbed by B.' (%) (meleed by the hiding B, an <a href="assassin.html">Assassin</a>)</li>
<li>'A was squashed by B's carving frenzy.' (was standing on a boulder source just when B, a <a href="miner.html">Miner</a>
finished carving a boulder there)</li>
<li>'A was poisoned by B's needle.' (%) (died of poison after being pricked by B, a <a href="healer.html">Healer</a>)</li>
<li>'A fell into oblivion.' (walked into a chasm)</li>
<li>'A drowned.' (failed to swim)</li>
<li>'A suicided.' (%) (default key-binding is 'X')</li>
<li>'A was scared to death by B.' (%) (suicided while too close to the enemy B)</li>
</ul>
Only <a href="mindcrafter.html">mindcrafters</a> and <a href="scout.html">scouts</a> do not have any 'special' way
of killing enemies.</p>

<p>'B' can be replaced by 'TEAMMATE B' if it was a team kill. This is possible with
arrows, zaps, magic missiles, planted traps, set fireball traps, circular attacks,
and squashing with a boulder. In that case, a death is recorded to A but B gets
no kill for slaying a teammate (see <a href="statistics.html">Statistics</a>).</p>

<p>You can also kill yourself with zaps, mms, and boobytraps. The messages are then 'A was zapped by herself', 'A could not outrun her own magic missile', and
'A failed to notice her own boobytrap'.</p>

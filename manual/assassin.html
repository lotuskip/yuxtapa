<h2>Assassin</h2>

<p>pros: very high DV, very accurate melee attack<br>
cons: no PV, lowish HPs, no torch</p>

<h3>Abilities</h3>
<ul>
<li>Hiding (in the dark, by walls)</li>
<li>Backstabbing</li>
<li>Quiet swimmer</li>
<li>Flash bombs</li>
<li>Immune to blinding</li>
</ul>

<p>Hiding ability: whenever you walk into a non-lit tile (see <a href="vision.html">Vision and hearing</a>)
that is next to a wall tile and no enemy within a 3 tiles distance sees you there, you become invisible to
all enemies.</p>

<p>You become visible again if you either move so that one of the above
conditions is not satisfied, or if an enemy walks 'right at you', which technically means:
is facing at a square that is at most 1 square away from the square you're at.</p>

<p><em>To reiterate:</em> as long as you stay still, the area becoming lit or even the neighbouring wall
getting dug away by a friendly <a href="miner.html">miner</a> does not make you visible: only your moving
or an enemy walking into you makes you visible again.</p>

<p>Note that if you are carrying the treasure item (see <a href="gametypes.html">Game types</a>), any movement
leaves a visible trail that remains for a number of turns, thus making it extremely
difficult to remain hidden. (The enemies might not see <em>you</em>, i.e. your '@', but they very likely see the
background colour that indicates the treasure item's movement.)</p>

<p>If you attack an enemy in melee while hiding, your attack is more deadly (see <a href="rulemech.html">Rule mechanics</a> for details).
This is sometimes referred to as <em>backstabbing</em>.</p>

<p>The other ability of Assassins is to activate 'light bombs'. These act as if a
light trap (see <a href="traps.html">Traps</a>) was activated at the assassin's location.
Assassins themselves are immune to blindness &mdash; both from their own light
bombs and from light traps.</p>

<p>You only have 3 light bombs per spawning at your disposal.</p>

<p>Finally, assassins do not make noise when they swim in water.</p>

<h2>Recording sessions</h2>

<p>This is not really a feature of yuxtapa, but worth mentioning still.</p>

<p>Using the external program <a href="http://0xcc.net/ttyrec/index.html.en">ttyrec</a>
it is possible to record
sessions of playing yuxtapa (on the client side). These can be later
viewn using either the viewer that comes with ttyrec or with
some of the other viewer programs (these exist for Windows, too,
and there are even online viewers).</p>

<p>It is assumed that you can manage installing ttyrec on your system.
To record a session, instead of executing the client in the usual
manner, type
<pre>ttyrec -e yuxtapa_cl</pre>
This will record the entire
session. To view the recording, run 'ttyplay [name of the recording file]'.
Add the flag '-s2' to double the playback speed. During playback,
you can hit '+' or '-' to increase or decrease the speed, or '1'
to reset the normal speed.</p>

<p>The command 'ttytime [file]' can be used to tell the length of a recording
in seconds.</p>

<h2>Recording sessions</h2>

<p>This is not really a feature of yuxtapa, but worth mentioning still.</p>

<p>It is possible to record sessions of playing yuxtapa (on the client side). Obviously this can be achieved
with any desktop capturing software, but ones that work in a terminal only produce
much smaller files (the recordings are basically text, not video; they can be made <em>really</em> small
if compressed).</p>

<h3>The script way</h3>
<p>For GNU/Linux users, the best choise is the 'script' command. Basic usage (see the
man page, 'man script', for more information):
<pre>
script -t 2&gt; game.timing -a game.session
</pre>
records your sessions into the file 'game.session', with timing information in
the file 'game.timing'. Two separate files are a necessity when using script; to share the recording
just tar it together, e.g.:
<pre>
tar -czf gamerec.tar.gz game.timing game.session
</pre>
The command
<pre>
scriptreplay game.timing game.session
</pre>
replays the session.</p>

<p>Note that script records everything that goes on in your terminal, so you must
first invoke script (first of the above commands) and then run the yuxtapa client,
and after playing, quit script to end the recording (either type 'exit' or hit CTRL+d).</p>


<h3>The ttyrec way</h3>

<p>Using the external program <a href="http://0xcc.net/ttyrec/index.html.en">ttyrec</a>
you can record sessions into files that can be viewn with
programs that exist for Windows, too, and there are even online viewers.</p>

<p>It is assumed that you can manage installing ttyrec on your system.
To record a session, instead of executing the client in the usual
manner, type
<pre>ttyrec -e yuxtapa_cl</pre>
This will record the entire
session. To view the recording, run 'ttyplay [name of the recording file]'.
Add the flag '-s2' to double the playback speed. During playback,
you can hit '+' or '-' to increase or decrease the speed, or '1'
to reset the normal speed.</p>

<p>The command 'ttytime [file]' can be used to tell the length of a recording
in seconds.</p>

<p>The major downside of ttyrec is this: <em>you are limited to a screen size of 80x24</em>.
yuxtapa is perfectly playable in such a small screen, but the chat space is only one line
high...</p>

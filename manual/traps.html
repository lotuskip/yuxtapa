<h2>Traps</h2>

<p>The maps in yuxtapa often have hidden traps that can damage you or disturb your
playing in some other way.</p>

<p>Traps that you know about are drawn with a '^' symbol (traps that you don't
know about obviously aren't drawn at all). The colour of the symbol tells the
type of the trap (see below).</p>

<p>Walking over a trap you don't know about automatically causes the trap to be
triggered. Walking over a known trap if the area is lit is safe: the trap won't
be triggered. However, in the dark you might accidentally trigger a trap even
if you know about it!</p>

<p>You can intentionally trigger a trap you're standing on (the default key binding
is 'T'). <a href="archer.html">Archers</a> can trigger traps by hitting them with arrows.</p>

<h3>Detecting traps</h3>

<p>Traps are detected by remaining still, doing nothing (your PC is then assumed
to be looking around for traps). Traps that are within 3 tiles can be detected
this way.</p>

<p>A <a href="trapper.html">trapper</a> only needs half of the normal time to detect traps.
A <a href="scout.html">scout</a> needs 3/4. These two classes also detect all traps automatically.
All other classes have a 60% &mdash; 75% if the location is lit &mdash; chance to detect each trap.</p>

<p>Everyone will automatically see the traps detected by teammates. Trappers obviously
detect immediately the traps they themselves leave.</p>

<p>You can, of course, also detect a trap by just walking into it and setting it off. This
won't happen if you don't survive the trap, though, and it never happens with teleportation
traps, either.</p>


<h3>Trap types</h3>
<p><em>Fireball traps</em> (red ^) cause an explosion that damages everyone in a radius 
of 2 tiles. The damage is higher close to the trap &mdash; the triggerer herself rarely survives.
The explosion also lights the area around it. If you kill someone by stepping on a trap, you are
responsible (or get the credit) for the kill. The fiery explosion also lights the torches of any PCs who
survive it.</p>

<p><em>Light traps</em> (yellow ^) blind you for a few turns. While blind, you can carry
out all actions as usual, but can't see anything on your screen. <a
href="assassin.html">Assassins</a> are immune to blinding.</p>

<p><em>Water traps</em> (blue ^) will instantly extinguish your torch if it is lit, and
might rust your melee weapon causing a penalty to your to-hit and your melee damage.
The penalties won't go away until you die and respawn.</p>

<p><em>Teleport traps</em> (green ^) will teleport you to a random location. That location
might be a chasm or a water tile, too. It is possible to resist the effect of these traps
with magic resistance, see <a href="rulemech.html">Rule mechanics</a>.</p>

<p><em>Booby traps</em> (gray ^) can be randomly generated like the other traps, or set
by <a href="trapper.html">trappers</a>. They damage the one who triggers them. A booby
trap always disappears once triggered.</p>

<p><em>Acid traps</em> (cyan/green ^) function like boobytraps except that they do not vanish when
triggered, cannot be planted by trappers, and generate a splashing sound.</p>

<p>Triggering any kind of trap makes noise, which can give out your position. Thus, no trap is ever completely harmless.</p>

<h2>Introduction to yuxtapa</h2>

<p>yuxtapa is a console-based real-time multiplayer game taking influences from
roguelike games and some teamplay focused first-person-shooter games. It has a loose fantasy setting, but no actual background story.</p>

<p>The game features randomly generated maps and ten quite different character
classes to choose from. The focus is very much on teamplay and cooperation.</p>

<p>Screenshots are available on the <a href="http://tempoanon.net/lotuskip/yuxtapa/">homepage</a>.</p>

<p>Games that have influenced the design of yuxtapa and deserve a special mention:
<ul>
<li>Roguelikes: <em>ADOM</em>, <em>Dungeon Crawl</em>, <em>DoomRL</em></li>
<li>Multiplayer games: particularly <em>Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory</em></li>
</ul></p>

<p>yuxtapa is available only for Linux-like operating systems. It is open source
and actively developed.</p>

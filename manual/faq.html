<h2>Frequently asked</h2>

<p>(Frequently complained, rather?)</p>

<dl>
<dt><em>The game looks horrible, nothing like the screenshots!</em></dt>
<dd>See <a href="terminals.html">Terminals</a>.</dd>

<dt><em>The game is sluggish!</em></dt>
<dd>Probably it isn't. It just functions in discrete time, see <a href="timesystem.html">Time system</a>.
It takes a little bit of getting used to to get 'into the rhythm'. (If you still
insist that the game is sluggish, take a look at the indicator animation: if it
runs smoothly (evenly), it's not a question of the game being sluggish but the
player being impation and 'not in the rhythm'.)</dd>

<dt><em>Some classes/abilities are overpowered/useless!</em></dt>
<dd>Probably true. Tell the author which ones and how and, if you can, suggest how to
fix this.</dd>

<dt><em>Why is the equivalent of green <strong>teal</strong> in the 16 colour mode?</em></dt>
<dd>Not the equivalent of green in general, just of the green team. It seemed like it would give an unfair benefit
to the green team if their PCs were the same colour as the ground&amp;trees&amp;marsh as if camoflauged.</dd>

<dt><em>Water traps rust weapons but swimming in water doesn't. WTF?</em></dt>
<dd>If you go into water, you know you're going into water and can protect your weapon from getting wet. Water traps come as
a surprise to the PC (or are intentionally triggered, which would be somewhat silly).</dd>

<dt><em>I found a bug!</em></dt>
<dd>Good! <a href="bugs.html">'Call upon the author to explain!'</a></dd>

<dt><em>There was an inaccessible location generated. That sucks.</em></dt>
<dd>Some places <em>are</em> inaccessible, that's why we have the word 'inaccessible'. Then again,
was it <em>really</em> inaccessible? Remember that miners can dig and mindcrafters can
blink and bridges can be made with boulders. Besides, why would you want to go there,
anyway? Or were you spawned there? That <em>does</em> suck! Maybe pick another class and
suicide?</dd>

<dt><em>I am getting a message about someone using my ID on the server and cannot connect!</em></dt>
<dd>This should be extremely rare. If it happens often, something is wrong (a bug?). However, the remedy
is to remove the line corresponding to this server from the 'servers' file in the config directory
and reconnect. This will lose your stats on that server, sadly.</dd>

<dt><em>I forgot to make myself super-admin and now some jack-ass has hijacked my server!</em></dt>
<dd>Shutdown the server and delete the file '.playerdata' in the config dir. Then try again.</dd>

<dt><em>How do I shutdown a server that is running on a remove machine?</em></dt>
<dd>Send a SIGINT to the process through ssh: 'killall -INT yuxtapa_sv'</dd>

<dt><em>The server won't start up, it says: &quot;Failed to bind socket!&quot;</em></dt>
<dd>One possible reason: the server was uncleanly shut down while bots were active. Do 'killall [bot executable name]' and try again?</dd>

<h2>PC Torch</h2>

<p>See <a href="classov.html">Class overview</a> for which classes carry portable torches.
If you are playing one of these classes, you can light and extinguish
your torch with the 't' key (by default). This requires that one of the
following is satisfied:
<ul>
<li>you are a <a href="wizard.html">wizard</a></li>
<li>you are standing next to a teammate with a lit torch</li>
<li>you are standing on top of a stationary torch (see <a href="objects.html">Objects in the game</a>)</li>
</ul></p>

<p>The portable torches light a smaller radius than the stationary ones,
and they will burn out eventually. You won't get a new torch until you
die and respawn.</p>

<p>The torch indicator (see <a href="clientscreen.html">Client screen</a>) tells how much torch you
have left: from 'J' (plenty) to ';' (pretty little). The symbol ',' means
your torch is burned out. If there is no symbol at all, your torch is
currently extinguished, while '-' indicates that you don't even have one.</p>

<p>There are several benefits given by carrying torches in dark areas:
<ul>
<li>you generally see further</li>
<li>enemy <a href="assassin.html">assassins</a> and <a href="trapper.html">trappers</a> cannot hide from you</li>
<li>you will not accidentally set off any <a href="traps.html">traps</a> you know off</li>
<li>the likelihood of you noticing traps is higher (assuming you are not a trapper or a <a href="scout.html">scout</a>)</li>
</ul>
The only real trade-off, or a negative result, is that enemies can notice your torch light and thus know you're coming.</p>

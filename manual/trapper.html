<h2>Trapper</h2>

<p>pros: fairly strong, good abilities<br>
cons: no magic resistance, no torch</p>

<h3>Abilities</h3>
<ul>
<li>Set&amp;disarm traps</li>
<li>Detect traps</li>
<li>Hiding (on tree squares)</li>
<li>No terrain penalty</li>
<li>Can push boulders</li>
</ul>

<p>Trappers can leave boobytrap type <a href="traps.html">Traps</a>. The trap it placed at the
position of the PC, and placing it takes a few turns. This ability is used by simply hitting space.</p>

<p>If you hit space on a square that already has a trap, you will disarm that trap instead. Note
that outsiders looking at you cannot tell which action you are performing. Teammates will of course
see a newly planted trap when you move aside, but enemies still can't be certain whether you disarmed
a trap or left one.</p>

<p>One particular use of traps is to identify illusory walls: if a trap is
placed on an illusory wall tile, any player who knows about the trap will see
the trap instead of a wall.</p>

<p>Additionally, trappers can hide on non-lit tree squares ('T' symbol). The rules of
hiding are the same as for <a href="assassin.html">assassins</a>, except that hiding
can only take place when going into a tree square (with assassins it's: a square next
to a wall). Note that unlike assassins, trappers cannot backstab enemies from their hiding place; they just hide.</p>

<p>Trappers are great at detecting <a href="traps.html">Traps</a>, and do not suffer
a time penalty for walking over rough terrain or swamp.</p>

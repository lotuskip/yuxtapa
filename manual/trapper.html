<h2>Trapper</h2>

<p>pros: fairly strong, good abilities<br>
cons: no magic resistance, no torch</p>

<h3>Abilities</h3>
<ul>
<li>Set traps</li>
<li>Detect traps</li>
<li>Hiding (on tree squares)</li>
<li>No terrain penalty</li>
</ul>

<p>Trappers can leave boobytrap type <a href="traps.html">Traps</a>. The trap it placed at the
position of the PC, and placing it takes a few turns.</p>

<p>Additionally, trappers can hide on non-lit tree squares ('T' symbol). The rules of
hiding are the same as for <a href="assassin.html">assassins</a>, except that hiding
can only take place when going into a tree square. Note that unlike assassins,
trappers cannot backstab enemies from their hiding place; they just hide.</p>

<p>Trappers are great at detecting <a href="traps.html">Traps</a>, and do not suffer
a time penalty for walking over rough terrain or swamp.</p>

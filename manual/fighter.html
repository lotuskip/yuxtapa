<h2>Fighter</h2>

<p>pros: great in melee (the whole package: defense, offense, and protection + a great ability to boot)<br>
cons: short LOS-radius, no magic resistance</p>


<h3>Abilities</h3>
<ul>
<li>Circular attack</li>
<li>can push boulders</li>
</ul>

<p>The circular attack is activated by pressing space and giving a direction. The
strike takes two turns to carry out, and will hit four adjacent squares per turn,
as if the PC attacks all those directions simultanously.</p>

<p>The attacks moves clockwise starting at the direction the player gave (player hits space + 6):
<pre>
          xxx
   @x     x@
  xxx
 turn 1  turn 2
(x: a square that is attacked)
</pre></p>

<p>The damage and to-hit of the circular attack are not the same as those of the
Fighter's regular melee attack; see <a href="rulemech.html">Rule mechanics</a>.</p>

<p>It is possible to make only half a circle by moving before the second part of the attack starts.
This is almost always preferable to regular melee attacks, assuming
you can do it quickly enough.</p>

<p><em>Warning</em>: the circular attack can damage teammates, as well!</p>

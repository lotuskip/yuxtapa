<h2>Time system</h2>

<p>yuxtapa is a <em>discrete time game</em>, which means that it's somewhere between
regular real-time and turn-based. You could say that yuxtapa has <em>turns</em>,
but they are of fixed (and very short) length.</p>

<p>One <em>turn</em> in yuxtapa is a time interval of 250 milliseconds (typically,
this can be changed in the <a href="serverconf.html">Server configuration</a>, but you shouldn't
unless there's a very good reason). That means that there are four turns
per second. Note that the indicator animation (see <a href="clientscreen.html">Client screen</a>)
updates every turn, assuming you did receive the server update.</p>

<p>The server sends an update of the situation every turn, and inbetween
these updates players can act. Their actions are processed in order
of arrival, and after 250ms have passed, the new situation is rendered.</p>

<p>So, events occur in the order the server received them, but a unified description
of the situation is sent to the clients only every turn. You could say the effects of
the players' actions are <em>gathered</em> together every 250ms.
The system <em>might</em> render later events void, for example:
<ul>
<li>A attacks B, but B, a <a href="mindcrafter.html">Mindcrafter</a>, blinks away first
<ul>
<li>B blinks as intended</li>
<li>A ends up moving to B's previous location, and no attack takes place</li>
</ul></li>
<li>A shoots an arrow, but B attacks A first and A dies
<ul>
<li>A will never shoot the arrow, for she is dead!</li>
<li>if A does not die, she'll shoot the arrow despite being attacked</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></p>

<p>
The symbols on the screen represent the situation on the current turn;
where everything is in your field of vision. The <em>background colours</em>,
if there are any, always represent effects of the few previous turns; see
<a href="vision.html">Vision and hearing</a>.</p>

<p>Every time you press a key to take an action (eg. move around), the client
delivers this request to the server &mdash; even if you somehow do it 10 times a turn.
But the server accepts only one action per turn per player, and it will queue
only a certain number of additional actions per client for processing.</p>

<p>If the storage is empty when a new action arrives, the action takes effect
immediately (this is what the players should aim for: to take only one
action per turn). If the storage for a client is full, further actions are
ignored. If the storage is neither empty nor full, the newly arrived
action is added to it. Actions in the queue are, in the server logic,
processed <em>after</em> those that are processed immediately, and thus they
take effect later, too. While this <em>might</em> be beneficial in some rare
occasions, it is usually not desirable.</p>

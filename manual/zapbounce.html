<h2>Zap bouncing</h2>

<p>The bouncing of bolts in yuxtapa is based on the rules in roguelike games such
as ADOM, but with certain quite important differences. For the exact algorithm,
the reader is referred to the source code, but some essential examples are
given below.</p>

<p>In the below pictures, the bolt starts at the point marked with @ and travels
in the path marked by '/', '\', '|', and '-'. The '#' denote walls. Zaps only
bounce off of walls; other entities they either pass or become absorbed and
disappear.</p>

<p>
The following situations are exactly like in games such as ADOM:
<pre>
#####                #           ##             ##
  |            @-----#            ##             ##
  |                  #           / ##            /##
  @                  #          /   ##          /  ##
                               @               @
</pre>
Above, the bolt will bounce back to the '@' travelling along the same path.
The same thing happens if the bolt hits a 'pillar' (a single wall tile):
<pre>
 @---#         @           @
               |          /
               |         /
               #        #
</pre>
Here the bolt bounces 'in a 45 degree angle':
<pre>
#######              @  #
  /\                  \ #
 /  \                  \#
@                      /#
                      / #
</pre></p>

<p>In ADOM, 'diagonal walls' behave in a square way; visually intuitively, but
rather unintuitively if you think about it. As if 'turning the world 45 degrees'
would utterly change the behaviour. This cannot be completely remedied,
but yuxtapa makes an attempt, anyhow. The following bounce you won't see in ADOM:
<pre>
  ##
   ##
@---##
    |##
    | ##
</pre>
Here the bolt bounces 'in a 45 degree angle' off of a diagonal wall. Compare to the
previous two pictures, where the wall is horizontal or vertical.</p>

<p>Since the algorithm to determine the bounces is rather simple (and complicating it too
much is not desirable), there is a side effect. The following bounce, which will
happen in yuxtapa according to the current rules, seems a bit arbitrary:
<pre>
   #
   #
@--#
   |
   |
</pre>
Here the vertical wall ends abruptly, and a bolt hitting the very end of it makes
a weird bounce as if it had hit a diagonal wall.</p>

<h2>Objects in the game</h2>

<h3>Boulders</h3>

<p>
<pre><font style="background-color:black;color:gray">O</font></pre>
Boulders are inanimate objects that some PCs can push around. To push a boulder, simply
walk against it. Boulders can only be pushed on level ground, not on rough terrain or
in swamp. <a href="classov.html">Classes</a> that can push boulders are <a href="fighter.html">Fighter</a>,
<a href="mindcrafter.html">Mindcrafter</a>, <a href="miner.html">Miner</a>, and
<a href="trapper.html">Trapper</a>. Pushing a boulder takes twice as long as regular movement.</p>

<p>Miners can also destroy boulders, by mining them. This requires that the boulder is 'blocked'. Destroying all the boulders in a
certain area can be the mission objective; see <a href="gametypes.html">Game types</a>. In a dungeon (see <a href="maptypes.html">Map types</a>),
a boulder can also be destroyed by pushing it into a chasm.</p>

<p>Arrows or spells will not pass boulders, and you cannot walk over a boulder that you cannot push.
Boulders, however, do not block sight or light.</p>

<p>Boulders cannot be pushed through doorways or on top of flags. Pushing a boulder into water
destroys the boulder and creates a bridge (appears as a floor tile). Boulders can be used
to block portal exits (see below), preventing the usage of the portal (and effectively also <em>hiding</em>
the portal from sight).</p>


<h3>Boulder sources</h3>

<p>
<pre><font style="background-color:black;color:gray">_</font></pre>
If a <a href="miner.html">Miner</a> mines a boulder source, a new boulder is created. For other classes a boulder source
has no actual effect. However, if a PC is standing on the boulder source
when a miner finishes carving a boulder, that PC is killed and the miner gets the kill.</p>


<h3>Corpses</h3>

<p>
<pre><font style="background-color:black;color:green">%</font>, <font style="background-color:black;color:purple">%</font></pre>
These are often left when PCs die (see <a href="waystodie.html">ways to die</a>). They will vanish quite quickly, so seeing them is
usually a sign of a recent battle. They are of particular importance to <a href="scout.html">scouts</a>.</p>


<h3>Doors</h3>

<p>
<pre><font style="background-color:black;color:brown">\</font> (open)
<font style="background-color:black;color:brown">+</font> (closed)</pre>
Doors are basically 'walls that you can open and close'. When closed, they are
inpassable and cannot be seen through. When open, they are just like any ground
or floor tile, except that boulders cannot pass them.</p>

<p>A closed door is opened simply by walking against it.</p>

<p>To close a door, use the command 'c' (default). This will close any door <em>next to you</em>.
If there are several doors next to you, the one closest to your <a href="facing.html">facing</a>
direction is picked. If two doors are equally possible, you will close either one
(not at random, but according to certain logic not worth being explained here).</p>


<h3>Flags</h3>

<p>
<pre><font style="background-color:black;color:gray">&amp;</font>, <font style="background-color:black;color:green">&amp;</font>, <font
style="background-color:black;color:purple">&amp;</font></pre>
Flags are where player characters spawn. See <a href="limbo.html">Limbo and Spawning</a> and
<a href="gametypes.html">Game types</a>.</p>


<h3>Portals</h3>

<p>
<pre><font style="background-color:black;color:blue">0</font> (two-way)
<font style="background-color:black;color:blue">A</font> (one-way entry)
<font style="background-color:black;color:gray">V</font> (one-way exit)</pre>
When you walk into a portal other than 1-way exit, you are instantly teleported to
another portal. You must actually <em>walk</em> in; blinking onto a portal or moving there
by switcing position won't teleport you. You also won't be teleported if there is
no exit available (an exit is unavailable if someone is standing on it or has pushed
a boulder to block it).</p>

<p>Two-way portals are linked in a chain. When you walk into one, you are teleported
to the next one in the chain, or if that one is blocked, the next one after that etc.
When walking into a one-way portal entry, you are teleported to any random 1-way
exit, if there are unblocked ones left.</p>


<h3>Torches</h3>

<p>
<pre><font style="background-color:black;color:orange">t</font></pre>
These light a certain radius (see <a href="vision.html">Vision and hearing</a>). They can be used
to light a <a href="pctorch.html">portable torch</a> carried by a PC (stand on the 't' and hit the appropriate
key, 'u' by default).</p>


<h3>Traps</h3>

<p>
<pre><font style="background-color:black;color:red">^</font> (several colours)</pre>
See <a href="traps.html">Traps</a>.</p>


<h3>Treasure item</h3>
<p>
<pre><font style="background-color:black;color:yellow">=</font></pre>
A unique object that appears only in the <em>Steal</em> <a href="gametypes.html">game mode</a>.</p>


<h3>Trees</h3>

<a href="trapper.html">Trappers</a> can hide on non-lit tree tiles.</p>

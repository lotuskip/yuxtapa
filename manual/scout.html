<h2>Scout</h2>

<p>pros: longest LOS-radius<br>
cons: a very weak class in combat</p>

<h3>Abilities</h3>
<ul>
<li>Infliltration (disguise yourself as the enemy)</li>
<li>No terrain penalty</li>
<li>Quiet swimmer</li>
<li>Trap detection</li>
<li>Spot enemies for teammates</li>
</ul>

<p>The main special ability of scouts is <em>infiltration</em>, also known as
<em>disguising</em>.</p>

<p>When you see a corpse of an enemy (a '%' of the opposing team's colour),
walk over it and hit space to steal the clothes of the corpse. This
takes a few turns, after which you will appear to your enemies in their colour.
Your own teammates will see you as a brown '@'.</p>

<p>Your disguise falls off if you attack an enemy. The enemy can also notice
that you are not who you seem to be by other means and 'test attack' you: if they
walk into you, they'll carry out a melee attack, whereas if you really were
a teammate that wouldn't happen. (An explanation for the realists: you fail in the
secret hand-shake.) Also, you won't steal the 'identity' of the
corpse: if an enemy turns on her titles, she will notice that you are a
'teammate without a name', an infiltrator.</p>

<p>Scouts are also skilled in detecting <a href="traps.html">Traps</a>, do not suffer a time penalty
for walking over rought terrain or swamp, and don't make noise when swimming.</p>

<p>Finally, if a scout sees an enemy PC, this PC is automatically shown to
all nearby teammates, even if outside of their LOS. For instance:
<pre>
             .........
enemy PC --&gt; .@.....@. &lt;-- a scout
             ######...
                  #...
                  #@.. &lt;-- the scout's teammate
</pre>
Here, the enemy PC will be drawn for the scout's teammate, although outside
of her LOS.</p>

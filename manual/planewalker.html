<h2>Planewalker</h2>

<p>pros: decent in melee, good magic resistance, ability can be very useful</br>
cons: vulnerable when using ability (and mediocre if never uses it)</p>

<p>The special ability of planewalkers,
<em>mind's eye</em> (ME),
allows them to &quot;turn into a spectator&quot; and quickly go see far away locations or take a
peek right outside their LOS, even behind a wall. However, when they're using this ability and controlling their ME,
the PC herself is completely defenceless.</p>

<p>To use ME, simply hit space. Then you are controlling, instead of your PC, your
viewpoint, which is exactly like <a href="spectating.html">spectating</a>. You can hit space
again to immediately return to controlling your PC. It is possible to go see
what the enemy is doing on the other side of the map, make a quick scan of the
layout of an unknown map, or just simply look ahead a little further than your
normal vision reaches.</p>

<p>Some miscellaneous notes about using ME:
<ul>
<li>while using ME, the PC's DV is dropped down to 11, making her much easier to hit</li>
<li>the ME view is not affected by blindness. In fact, ME can be used to remove blindness
(this takes two actions, though: for turning ME on and off)</li>
<li>ME can also be used to detect distant traps (just like traps are normally detected; see <a href="traps.html">Traps</a>)</li>
<li>if a teammate switches places with you (see <a href="movement.html">Movement</a>) while you are using ME, your view is reset to your PC's location</li>
<li>if you take damage from any source, your view <em>is not</em> reset</li>
</ul></p>

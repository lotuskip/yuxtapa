<h2>Planewalker</h2>

<p>pros: decent in melee, good magic resistance, ability can be very useful for the team</br>
cons: vulnerable when using ability (and mediocre if never uses it)</p>

<p>Planewalker is definitely a team-player's class. Their special ability, <em>mind's eye</em> (ME)
allows them to &quot;turn into a spectator&quot; and quickly go see far away locations or take a
peek behind a wall. However, when they're using this ability and controlling their ME,
the PC herself is completely defenceless and needs protection from teammates.</p>

<p>To use ME, simply hit space. Then you are controlling, instead of your PC, your
viewpoint, which is exactly like <a href="spectating.html">spectating</a>. You can hit space
again to immediately return to controlling your PC.</p>

<p>Some miscellaneous notes about using ME:
<ul>
<li>while using ME, the PC's DV is dropped down to 11, making her much easier to hit</li>
<li>the ME view is not affected by blindness. In fact, ME can be used to remove blindness
(this takes two actions, though: for turning ME on and off)</li>
<li>ME can also be used to detect distant traps (just like traps are normally detected; see <a href="traps.html">Traps</a>)</li>
<li>if a teammate switches places with you (see <a href="movement.html">Movement</a>) while you are using ME, your view is reset to your PC's location</li>
<li>if you take damage from any source, your view <em>is not</em> reset</li>
</ul></p>

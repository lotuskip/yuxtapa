<h2>Planewalker</h2>

<p>pros: decent in melee, good magic resistance, ability can be very useful for team</br>
cons: vulnerable when using ability (and mediocre when not using it)</p>

<p>Planewalker is definitely a team-player's class. Their special ability, <em>mind's eye</em>
allows them to &quot;turn into a spectator&quot; and quickly go see far away locations or take a
peek behind a wall. However, when they're using this ability and controlling their mind's eye,
the PC herself is completely defenceless and needs protection from teammates.</p>

<p>To use the mind's eye, simply hit space. Then you are controlling, instead of your PC, your
mind's eye, which is exactly like <a href="spectating.html">spectating</a>. You can hit space
again to immediately return to controlling your PC.</p>

<h2>Map saving</h2>

<p>It is possible to save the currently played map with a given name into a file and load a previously saved map to play. If the game happens to
generate an awesome map you can save it for a future replay instead of losing it.</p>

<p>The saving is done with the command <em>!storemap [name]</em> where <em>[name]</em> is simultaneously the filename and an identifier for the
map. In order to save maps, you must define a directory for them in the <a href="serverconf.html">server configuration</a>. A previously saved
map can be recalled with the command <em>!nextmap [name]</em>.
A list of saved maps is shown with the command <em>!listmaps</em> (although this simply prints out all the filenames in the map directory, all of which
might not be actual map files if the map directory is poorly defined).</p>

<p><strong>Remarks:</strong> not everything gets saved into the file. Actually only the &quot;raw map data&quot; is saved, which excludes at least:
game mode, flag positions, boulders, boulder sources, and portals. Moreover, if a map is modified by pushing boulders into water or by mining away some
walls, these modifications <em>are</em> saved along with the map.</p>

<p>The saved maps <em>are not</em> compressed!
The filesize of the largest allowed maps nears one megabyte. Great compressions ratios are usually achieved
by manual compression.</p>


<h3>Map editing</h3>

<p>The map files can be edited (or even created from scratch) manually with any text editor. The format of the file is the following:
<pre>
yux+apa mapfile v.2                     # line 1 should read exactly this for the map to work!
Saved on: 22/02/2011 15:12              # line 2 is a comment line and is ignored by the server
118                                     # line 3 gives the size of the map (number of lines/columns)
0                                       # line 4: should the map have static torches (0: no, 1: yes)
dun                                     # line 5: type of the map; 'dun' (dungeon), 'out' (outdoor)
</pre>
After this, the actual map data follows. There is one symbol per tile, and the number of
rows and columns should be exactly the number given above as the map size.</p>

<p>The symbols and corresponding tiles:
<pre>
.  ground (grass)
,  road/dirt
_  floor/rock
;  rough terrain
^  swamp
~  water
+  closed door
\  open door
#  a wall, diggable
H  an undiggable wall
|- windows
</pre></p>


<h3>Generating maps without a running server&amp;client</h3>

<p>By configuring the building process with
<pre>./configure --enable-maptest</pre>
you can build a server binary that only generates a random map and exits. (Add '--disable-client' to disable building the client, too.)</p>

<p>The produced executable is still called 'yuxtapa_sv', but you might want to rename it to something else, like 'yuxtapa_mg' (map generator). Then run it
with
<pre>./yuxtapa_mg [N] [file]</pre>
where <em>N</em> is the size of the map to generate (exact number, no randomisation takes place). The second argument is optional. If given, it is taken as
the filename for the generated map (no argument: map is only printed on screen, not saved anywhere). Give full path if necessary; otherwise the file is
placed in the working directory.</p>

<h2>Wizard</h2>

<p>pros: spell can be very effective, very high magic resistance<br>
cons: the weakest class, terrible in melee</p>

<h3>Abilities</h3>
<ul>
<li>Cast magic missiles</li>
<li>Self-lighting torch</li>
</ul>

<p>Wizards' special ability is a spell named <em>magic missile</em>, MM for short.
It fires 4 missiles, marked by asterisks, '*', in your <a href="facing.html">facing direction</a>, its
opposite direction, and the two normal directions:
<pre>
either     or
<font style="background-color:black;color:magenta">* *         *&nbsp;
 </font><font style="background-color:black;color:green">@         </font><font style="background-color:black;color:magenta">*</font><font style="background-color:black;color:green">@</font><font style="background-color:black;color:magenta">*
* *         *&nbsp;</font>
</pre>
Note that a missile can only be created at a non-occupied location. Hence, if
there is a wall, a boulder, an enemy, or something else there, no missile is created.</p>

<p>To fire the four MMs, simply hit space.
Using the ability is limited as described <a href="limiting.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>
The missiles behave in the following way:
<ul>
<li>They move 1 tile per turn (as fast as PCs, but aren't slown down by terrain)</li>
<li>First they move straight for 1 turns in the direction they were shot</li>
<ul>
<li>They won't travel on the turn they were created; hence it is in principle possible to <em>run into your own MM</em> right after casting it</li>
</ul>
<li>After this they will automatically move towards the nearest enemy</li>
<ul>
<li>If there is no enemy within 15 tiles, they keep moving straight</li>
<li>Note that the <em>nearest enemy</em> can change every turn</li>
</ul>
<li>If a missile hits a PC, it deals damage and disappears</li>
<li>If a missile hits a wall, a boulder, or another missile, it disappears</li>
<li>If a missile hits a tree, it has a fixed chance of disappearing, or it
&quot;miss&quot; the tree and continue like nothing happened</li>
</ul></p>

<p>Note that there is no pathfinding involved: the MMs will <em>not</em> avoid
walls, friendly PCs, <em>or even the wizard herself!</em></p>

<p>Also note that the MMs don't exactly 'beeline' to the target. Rather,
they <em>turn</em>, somewhat slowly you could say. Consider the following example.
The '@' is an enemy, who remains still. The direction of the MM, '*', is
shown by a bar.
<pre>
turn 1   turn 2   turn 3   turn 4   turn 5 ... hits on turn 7
.......  .......  ../....  ..*-...  ...*...
.......  .|.....  .*.....  .......  ....\..
.\...@.  .*...@.  .....@.  .....@.  .....@.
..*....  .......  .......  .......  .......
</pre></p>


<p>Another ability of the wizards is to light their <a href="pctorch.html">torch</a> whenever,
not just when standing on a static torch (see <a href="objects.html">Objects in the game</a>)
or next to teammate with a lit torch.</p>

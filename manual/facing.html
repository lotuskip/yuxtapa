<h2>Facing</h2>

<p>yuxtapa has a simplified facing system, that affects just a couple of
things (most importantly <a href="wizard.html">wizards</a>). Each PC is facing to
some of the 8 possible directions.</p>

<p>Initially, the facing is up/north. Any of the following actions change
the facing to the direction of the action: moving (whatever the result),
healing (not self), mining, closing a door, shooting, zapping,
doing a circle attack.</p>

<h2>Game types</h2>

<p>There are two teams in yuxtapa, the <em>green</em> team and the <em>purple</em> team.
You can play one of five game types or modes, two where both teams have an equal goal,
and three where the green team attacks and the purple defends. Other than this, the teams
are identical; it doesn't make a difference in which you play.</p>

<p>The player characters spawn (see <a href="limbo.html">Limbo and spawning</a>) at
<em>flags</em>, '&amp;' symbols in the view, which can be controlled by either or neither team. A character can only
spawn at a flag controlled by its team, and you can capture a flag to your team
simply by walking over it. Some flags might not be capturable depending on the game mode and situation.</p>

<p>The maps are divided into sectors or areas, specified by directions:
<pre>
-----------
|NW  N  NE|
|         |
|W   C   E|
|         |
|SW  S  SE|
-----------
</pre>
The sector your PC is currently in is shown in the <a href="clientscreen.html">Client view</a>.</p>

<p>The rest of this page describes the game modes.</p>

<h3>Dominion</h3>
<p>In this game mode, the teams are in an equal position, both trying to gain
control of all of the spawn flags. The game ends if time runs out (this is
considered a tie), or if either team is without a spawn flag when it is
their turn to spawn, in which case that team loses.</p>

<h3>Conquest</h3>
<p>This is almost the same as dominion, except that the purple team takes a
defensive stance. The differences in the rules, compared to dominion, are:
<ul>
<li>purple team can only capture neutral flags</li>
<li>hence, when the green team captures a flag, this capture is final</li>
<li>purple can only win by holding on until the time runs out</li>
</ul></p>

<h3>Steal</h3>
<p>A 'treasure item', a yellow '=' is initially lying somewhere on the map. The green team
has to take it to their initial flag; the purple team tries to prevent this.</p>

<p>A green team player picks up the item by walking over it. A PC carrying the item
has the 'trapping' indicator background colour trailing him (see <a href="vision.html">Vision and hearing</a>),
but only if she has moved during the last few turns.</p>

<p>If the carrying PC dies, the item is dropped to wherever she was at that time.
Note that if this is on a chasm tile, the purple team has practically won: the item
is lost into the chasm (it is drawn brown instead of yellow when in chasm).</p>

<p>If the item-carrying PC touches her team's initial flag, the green team wins. The purple
team cannot carry the item, but can only defend it and stall the green team.</p>

<p>In this mode, any flag can be captured by either team, except that neither team can
be left completely without a flag. <em>If the green team's original flag is captured by
the purples</em>, the green team now needs to take the treasure to the flag they captured
first! (More precisely: always to the flag that has been under uninterrupted green control for
the longest time.)</p>

<h3>Destroy</h3>
<p>The green team attempts to destroy all the boulders (see <a href="objects.html">Objects in the game</a>) in
a specified area. There are initially a number of boulders standing there. The green
team can either destroy them using <a href="miner.html">miners</a> or push them away from the
particular sector or into water or chasm. Note that if a boulder is generated on rough terrain
or is otherwise unmovable, only miners can destroy it. The purple team can also construct
more boulders using boulder sources, if there are any.</p>

<p>The only way for the green team to win is to have that one particular sector
boulder-free at the time of the purple team's spawning. The amount of boulders left is
displayed as the objective state (see <a href="clientscreen.html">Client screen</a>), but note that this information is
only updated at the time of the purple team's spawn.</p>

<p>In this mode, any flag can be captured by either team, except that neither team can
be left without a flag.</p>

<h3>Team deathmatch</h3>
<p>This is a short (in map duration) and fast-paced (in spawn wait time) mode, in which the teams simply
compete in wasting each other off. The team that scores more kills (counted in the same way as personal
kills; see <a href="statistics.html">statistics</a>), wins. There is only one flag per team and obviously
flags cannot be captured.</p>

<p>Of course, despite the rules being simple, this mode, too, allows for quite a bit of tactics. It is pretty
much like most ball games; instead of scoring goals and protecting your own goal you just score kills and protect
your teammates from dying.</p>

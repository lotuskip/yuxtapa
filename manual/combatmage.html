<h2>Combat mage</h2>

<p>pros: high magic resistance, deadly ability (when used right)<br>
cons: deadly ability (when used wrong)</p>

<h3>Abilities</h3>
<ul>
<li>Firing zaps</li>
</ul>

<p>Zaps are bolt attacks that travel in a straight line, bouncing off of walls
and damaging anything they hit. The bouncing mechanish is explained and discussed
in <a href="zapbounce.html">Zap bouncing</a>.</p>

<p>To fire the zap, you must do the following:
<ul>
<li>hit space to go into spellcasting mode</li>
<li>hit the direction <em>right</em> of the direction you want to fire to</li>
<li>hit the direction <em>opposite</em> to the direction you want to fire to</li>
<li>hit the direction <em>left</em> of the direction you want to fire to</li>
<li>hit the direction you want to fire to</li>
</ul></p>

<p>For instance, to fire up/north, you must press 6248 (look at your numpad).
To fire bottom-left/south-west, you must press 7931.</p>

<p>Wrong keys in between, and you mess up and start over. You will know that you
screwed up the casting sequence if your PC starts to take steps before any
spell is released!</p>

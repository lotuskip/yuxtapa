<h2>Terminals</h2>

<p>The yuxtapa client has mainly been tested on <em>urxvt</em> (rxvt-unicode)
and <em>xterm</em>. It is designed for terminal emulators that provide at least 88 colours and
256 colour pairs, and moreover allow changing the colour RGB values. There is a fall-back function for more simple terminals (16 fixed colours)
such as xterm; the game is playable but looks more crude.</p>

<p>For comparison, here are two screenshots, the first with full colours, the second with
only 16 colours:<br>

<p>Playing with only 16 colours is quite possible, but most people will probably prefer the full colour mode.
Terminals that have been tested to work with full colours 'out-of-the-box':
<ul>
<li>rxvt-unicode</li>
<li>Eterm</li>
</ul></p>

<o>Terminals that similarly should work with full colours <em>once you reset the $TERM environment variable</em>
into something else than the default 'xterm':
<ul>
<li>roxterm</li>
<li>sakura</li>
<li>Konsole</li>
<li>evilvte</li>
</ul>
and many others, surely.
For instance Konsole allows changing the terminal identification in the
settings dialog, but you can also 'export TERM=[something]'. What exactly you
should place instead of '[something]', depends.</p>

<p>Please tell about your experiences on other terminal emulators so they can be added.</p>

<p>If you find the 'tallness' of everything an issue, try changing the font
of your terminal into something more square. This can help remove the illusion
that things to the left and right appear to be 'closer' than things that are
up or down. Unfortunately, good square fonts are hard to come by, especially
if you want unicode support. One decent square option is the font called 'cursor',
although it has the problem of being slightly large. Here is a screenshot:<br>

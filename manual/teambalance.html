<h2>Team balance</h2>

<p>As it's more fun to play 5 vs. 5 than 1 vs. 9, yuxtapa provides the option to
force balanced teams. The team balance option, defined in the <a href="serverconf.html">Server configuration</a>
has three possible values:</p>

<p><strong>off</strong>: no team balance of any kind. The server lets the players form the teams
the way they want. Even all on one side and no one on the other.</p>

<p><strong>passive</strong>: the server prevents team changes that would make the teams unbalanced.
In particular, if green team has less players than purple team, switching from green to purple is not allowed.
And vice versa. In other words, you can only switch into the team that has less players.</p>

<p><strong>active</strong>: in addition to the behaviour of the <em>passive</em> setting, in the active
mode the server will react to severe inbalance. If one side has two players more than
the other for more than 40 turns (that's 10 seconds on normal <a href="timesystem.html">time scaling</a>),
the server will send everyone a warning message, telling someone to switch sides.
If the situation isn't remedied by the players in another 40 turns, the server
will shuffle the teams, placing every non-spectator to a random team, equally many
to both teams (or one more in the other).</p>

<p>A player joining a team automatically joins the team with less players regardless of the team balance setting, but
if team balance is off, that player can immediately switch team if she so wishes.</p>

<p>Note that admins can also force a shuffle of the teams, see the list of commands in
<a href="chatting.html">Chatting and shouting</a>.</p>


<h3>Team shuffles</h3>
<p>A shuffle of the teams puts each player, who is currently not a spectator, randomly to
either the green or the purple team, so that in the end the teams have an equal number of players
(or if the amount of players is odd, one of the teams has one player more than the other).</p>

<p>The players are not treated equally in this shuffle, but they are first ordered according
to a comparison logic that takes into account the average time played as each
class and the kill/death ratio.
Players who have lots of kills and few deaths, and who have played a lot with
all classes will rank high.
The actual order of the players is not visible to the clients; all this is internal to the server.

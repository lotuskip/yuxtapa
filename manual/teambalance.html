<h2>Team balance</h2>

<p>As it's more fun to play 5 vs. 5 than 1 vs. 9, yuxtapa provides the option to
force balanced teams. The team balance option, defined in the <a href="serverconf.html">Server configuration</a>
has three possible values:</p>

<p><strong>off</strong>: no team balance of any kind. The server lets the players form the teams
the way they want. Even all on one side and no one on the other.</p>

<p><strong>passive</strong>: the server prevents team changes that would make the teams unbalanced.
In particular, if green team has less players than purple team, joining the purple
team is not allowed, and switching from the green to the purple team is not allowed
(leaving the green team in even more trouble by joining the spectators is allowed).
And the same thing if the purples has less players. In other words, you can join only
(or switch into) the team that less players.</p>

<p><strong>active</strong>: in addition to the behaviour of the <em>passive</em> setting, in the active
mode the server will react to severe inbalance. If one side has two players more than
the other for more than 40 turns (that's 10 seconds on normal <a href="timesystem.html">time scaling</a>),
the server will send everyone a warning message, telling someone to switch sides.
If the situation isn't remedied by the players in another 40 turns, the server
will shuffle the teams, placing every non-spectator to a random team, equally many
to both teams (or one more in the other).</p>

<p>Note that admins can also force a shuffle of the teams, see the list of commands in
<a href="chatting.html">Chatting and shouting</a>.</p>


<h3>Team shuffles</h3>
<p>A shuffle of the teams puts each player, who is currently not a spectator, randomly to
either the green or the purple team, so that in the end the teams have an equal number of players
(or if the amount of players is odd, one of the teams has one player more than the other).</p>

<p>The players are not treated equally in this shuffle, but they are first ordered according
to the following comparison logic:
<ul>
<li>The player with the higher <a href="adminlevels.html">AL</a> is placed higher</li>
<li>If the ALs are equal, certain reference numbers are compared. These are affected by
<ul>
<li>the average time played as each class</li>
<li>the kill/death ratio</li>
</ul>
so that players who have lots of kills and few deaths, and who have played a lot with all classes will rank high</li>
</ul>
The actual order of the players is not visible to the clients; all this is internal to the server.

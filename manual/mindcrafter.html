<h2>Mindcrafter</h2>

<p>pros: pretty good in all respects except:<br>
cons: lowish HPs, no torch</p>

<h3>Abilities</h3>
<ul>
<li>Blink (random teleport)</li>
<li>can push boulders</li>
</ul>

<p>The Mindcrafters can <em>blink</em> themselves away (or into) danger by
simply hitting space. This will effectively teleport the mindcrafter
instantly to a random square which is:
<ul>
<li>not occupied</li>
<li>passable</li>
<li>within the mindcrafter's line of sight, or just outside of it</li>
</ul>
The target position will be the furthest one possible, or a random one of
those if there are several options.</p>

<p>Some points to consider, though:</p>

<p>The blinking really is instantaneous; consider the following example.
<pre>
@ &lt;-- the Mc

    @ &lt;-- enemy PC
   X &lt;-- point where the Mc blinks
</pre>
Here we assume that the enemy PC is moving SW on the same turn, but that the
blinking action takes place before the move. The result: the enemy PC gets to
attack the Mc for free. On the other hand, if the enemy's move took place first, the
blinking destination could not be at 'X'; the enemy PC would now be there!</p>

<p>Another thing to keep in mind is that the destination square only needs to
be vacant. This means that you can blink into water and drown or into a chasm
and die instantly. If there is water or chasm in your LOS, only use blinking
if the risk is worth taking! (If you want to, for instance, cross a chasm
by blinking, you usually should blink right at the edge of the chasm to minimise
the risk.)</p>

<p>It can happen that there are no free squares to blink to. Then you simply
won't blink after all. This counts as an action, though, not as a turn spent
waiting.</p>

<p>The blinking ability is limited as described <a href="limiting.html">here</a>.</p>

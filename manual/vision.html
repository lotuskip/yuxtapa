<h2>Vision and hearing</h2>

<p>A typical view of an in-game situation in yuxtapa is given in
<a href="clientscreen.html">Client screen</a>.
The symbols are explained in <a href="mapsymbols.html">Map symbols</a>.</p>


<h3>Lighting</h3>

<p>There are three <em>lighting conditions</em> in yuxtapa: <em>lit</em>,
<em>not lit</em>, and <em>outside of LOS</em> (line of sight). Lit areas are drawn brighter,
areas outside of LOS dimmer and with less saturation.</p>

<p>The map can feature <em>torches</em> (see <a href="objects.html">Objects in the game</a>)
that light the area around them. Many player characters can carry <a href="pctorch.html">portable
torches</a> with them. In addition, the spells of <a href="wizard.html">wizards</a> and
<a href="combatmage.html">combat magi</a> create small temporary lights, as do triggered
fireball <a href="traps.html">traps</a>.</p>


<h3>Line of sight</h3>

<p>Each PC has a maximum LOS radius defined (see <a href="classov.html">Class overview</a>). This
describes the eyesight of the PC; not only how far she can see, but also
how accurately she sees. A PC with LOS radius 10 will possibly see more
within a radius of 4 than a PC with LOS radius only 6, even though both
in principle 'can see 4 tiles away' (this is actually a 'side effect' of
the LOS-algorithm).</p>

<p>The LOS radius given in <a href="classov.html">Class overview</a> determines the furthest the PC
can see <em>to lit areas</em>. Things that are in non-lit areas are only seen
if within a radius (LOS-rad + 5)/3. Note that the radius is given in the
so-called <a href="walkmetric.html">walk metric</a>.

<p>Consider the following example. Tiles that are lit are marked with an
'L' above them, and below are the distances from the PC, the '@'. Assume
the PC has LOS radius 7; then the reduced radius is 4.
<pre>
lit:  LLLLL  LL
      @...xyyz.
dist: 0   4  7
</pre>
Now the PC <em>can</em> see an object at 'x' or 'z', but <em>not</em> an object at either of the 'y's.</p>

<p>A second example, about the 'eyesight accuracy' issue:
<pre>
      ....#x..
      .@......
dist:  0   4
</pre>
Here the '#' is a wall or a pillar or something that anyway prevents seeing
through it. Assume, for simplicity, that the entire area shown here is lit. Now a PC
with a LOS radius 5 cannot see an enemy at 'x', even though that is within
the radius. But a PC with LOS radius 6 or more <em>can</em> see to 'x'! Hence
the statement that the LOS radius also measures eyesight <em>accuracy</em>, not just how
<em>far</em> you can see.</p>


<h3>Sounds</h3>
<p>yuxtapa features 'visual sound effects'. When something makes a noise and your PC
can hear it, this is indicated by an exclamation mark, '!', on the screen.
The position of the exclamation mark tells where the sound is coming
from, and the colour describes the sound.</p>

<p>The possible sounds and their colours:
<ul>
<li>blue !, 'a splash': someone hit by a water trap, or someone swimming</li>
<li>brown !, 'a creak': a door opened or closed, or a boobytrap going off</li>
<li>red !, 'a boom': a fireball trap went off (also indicates the area affected by the explosion)</li>
<li>yellow !, 'a zap': a zap of a <a href="combatmage.html">combat mage</a> bounced off of a wall</li>
<li>white !, 'a voice': see <a href="chatting.html">Chatting and shouting</a></li>
<li>green !, 'a whoosh': someone entering or exiting a portal</li>
<li>gray !, 'a rumble': a miner is digging or carving a block here</li>
</ul></p>


<h3>Action indicators</h3>
<p>If the background colour of a symbol is not black, this indicates that some
action took place at that location <em>in the past</em> (see <a href="timesystem.html">Time system</a>). The
possible indicators are the following:
<ul>
<li><strong>blue</strong>: someone was healed by a <a href="healer.html">healer</a> here</li>
<li><strong>red</strong>: an attack succesfully landed here (it did not necessarily deal any damage!)</li>
<li><strong>gray</strong>: an attack missed here (melee, arrow, magic missile, zap), or someone resisted a <a href="traps.html">
teleportation trap</a></li>
<li><strong>brown</strong>: a <a href="trapper.html">trapper</a> was/is setting a trap here; or someone is carrying the
<a href="gametypes.html">objective item</a></li>
<li><strong>green</strong>: a player was poisoned here by an enemy <a href="healer.html">healer</a></li>
<li><strong>yellow</strong>: a <a href="scout.html">scout</a> was/is disguising here</li>
</ul></p>

<p>Note that the object of the action might not be <em>there</em> any more! The symbols
represent current situation; the background colours are a peek to the past;
they reveal the effects of previous turns' events.</p>

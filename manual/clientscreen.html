<h2>Client screen</h2>

<p>A typical view of a yuxtapa client after succesfully connecting to a server and
joining a team:<br>
<img src="screenshot.png" alt="yuxtapa client screenshot"><br>
Things you see here:
<ol>
<li><strong>The View</strong> in which everything happens</li>
<li><strong>Chat screen</strong> showing things people say and messages from the server</li>
<li><strong>Event list</strong> more messages from the server; compared to those in the chat these are</li>
<ul>
<li>more 'private'; they can be different for each player, whereas the chat is global</li>
<li>more 'in-game', usually describing events that took place</li>
<li>more 'dynamic', usually describing events that took place <em>just now</em>, and scrolling the messages away automatically</li>
</ul>
<li><strong>PC info</strong> details about your player character</li>
<li><strong>Objective &amp; team info</strong> the <a href="gametypes.html">game mode</a>, objective status, and amounts of players in the teams</li>
<li><strong>Timers</strong>: time left to next <a href="intermission.html">Intermission</a> and to next
<a href="limbo.html">spawn</a> of your team</li>
<li><strong>Empty space</strong> this is where you type when you say something, see <a href="chatting.html">Chatting and shouting</a></li>
<li><strong>Indicators</strong> see below</li>
<li><strong>Area indicator</strong>; tells in which part of the map you currently are (very important in many game modes!)</li>
</ol></p>

<p>For more information on the contents of the view (1), see <a href="vision.html">Vision and hearing</a>,
<a href="mapsymbols.html">Map symbols</a>, and maybe <a href="timesystem.html">Time system</a>.</p>

<p>Note that the chat screen (2) will be as large as your terminal size allows, while all
other parts of the screen are of fixed size. It can be scrolled with the +/- keys (or
whatever they are mapped to).</p>

<p>The listing (4) is empty if you are only <a href="spectating.html">Spectating</a>.
The details listed are explained thoroughly in the <a href="rulemech.html">Rule mechanics</a> page, but roughly
speaking they are:
<ul>
<li>Your class; see <a href="classov.html">Class overview</a></li>
<li>HP: hitpoints, so-and-so many out of a maximum of such-and-such (when 0, you die)</li>
<li>DV and PV represent your evasion abilities and level of worn protection, respectively</li>
<li>The last line describes the accuracy and damage of your melee attack</li>
<li>If you are poisoned (see <a href="healer.html">Healer</a>), an indicator appears here (in the screenshot it is missing)</li>
</ul></p>

<p>The indicators (8) have an animation (by default a 'rotating' bar) which updates
whenever the client receives a view update from the server (see <a href="timesystem.html">Time system</a>).
If it runs 'smoothly', this means your connection is good. If it stops, this means
your connection to the server is down, or that the server is in <a href="intermission.html">intermission</a> mode.
If the animation jerks alot, you are connected but the connection is poor.</p>

<p>Another indicator, not visible in the screenshot, is the <em>walking indicator</em>. It is a
white letter 'W', right below the rotating bar. See <a href="movement.html">Movement</a> for more information on
this.</p>

<p>The third indicator (the left-most yellow one) is your torch status, see <a href="pctorch.html">PC Torch</a>.</p>

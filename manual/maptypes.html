<h2>Map types</h2>

<p>There are two main types of maps in yuxtapa: <em>dungeon</em> and <em>outdoor</em>.
Both of these can be either <em>inhabited</em>, which means that there are a large
number of houses and static torches (see <a href="objects.html">Objects in the Game</a>.</p>

<p>Both map types have level ground, rough ground, rock, water, and houses. Dungeons have also chasms, while
outdoor maps have roads&amp;grass (just like level ground, only different colour), trees, and swamp. Outdoor houses
can have windows (you can see but not pass through them).

<p><strong>Dungeon</strong> type maps consists of caverns, corridors, rooms, and 'nests' (very
crude and concealed caverns). They can contain ''chasms'', falling to which will
kill a player character. At least at the moment, dungeons do not contain water
or trees.</p>

<p><a href="trapper.html">Trappers</a> might be said to have a disadvantage in dungeons due to the
fact that there are no trees. <a href=miner.html">Miners</a> are of particular importance in dungeons,
since without them movement can be very limited.</p>

<p>In <strong>outdoor</strong> maps trappers are particularly powerful. Firstly, because
there are lots of trees giving them opportunities to hide, and secondly, because they
can move in swamp unhindered unlike most other classes. On the other hand, the openness
of the outdoor maps makes using <a href="traps.html">traps</a> less effective.
<a href="assassin.html">Assassins</a> are often weaker outdoors, due to the small amount of walls.</p>

<p><a href="wizard.html">Wizards</a> can be invaluable in uninhabited maps, because they can light their
torches without an existing static torch (and teammates can then light their torchers
using the wizard's torch).</p>

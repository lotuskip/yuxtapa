<h2>Map types</h2>

<p>There are two main types of maps in yuxtapa: <em>dungeon</em> and <em>outdoor</em>.
Both of these can be either <em>inhabited</em>, which means that there are a large
number of houses and static torches (see <a href="objects.html">Objects in the Game</a>), or not.</p>

<p>Both map types can contain level ground, rough ground, rock, water, and houses. Dungeons have also chasms, while
outdoor maps have roads&amp;grass (just like level ground, only different colour), trees, and swamp. Houses in outdoor maps
can have windows (tiles you can see but not pass through).

<p><a href="trapper.html">Trappers</a> might be said to have a disadvantage in dungeons due to the
fact that there are no trees. <a href=miner.html">Miners</a> are of particular importance in dungeons,
since without them movement can be very limited. In outdoor maps there are both less walls in general
and proportionately more undiggable walls.</p>

<p>In outdoor maps trappers are particularly powerful. Firstly, because
there are lots of trees giving them opportunities to hide, and secondly, because they
can move in swamp unhindered unlike most other classes. On the other hand, the openness
of the outdoor maps makes using <a href="traps.html">traps</a> less effective.
<a href="assassin.html">Assassins</a> are often weaker outdoors, due to the smaller amount of walls.</p>

<p><a href="wizard.html">Wizards</a> can be invaluable in uninhabited maps, because they can light their
torches without an existing static torch (and teammates can then light their torchers
using the wizard's torch).</p>

<h3>Annoying maps</h3>

<p>The map generation algorithm is highly randomised and is at parts based on somewhat chaotic mathematics.
To keep maps interesting and varied, it is necessary to allow some freedoms; these on the other hand lead to
very annoying maps every now and then: maps that are almost completely filled with rock (miners become a necessity),
maps that are almost totally flooded (can be extremely annoying to play), or maps that have huge chasms (might
render the map completely unplayable at worst).</p>

<p>&quot;Tweaking the values&quot; can minimise the chance of getting something nasty, but not remove it completely.
Occasionally, stupid maps <em>are</em> generated (at the moment, maybe once in 50 or 60 maps, or even less often if
your definition of stupid is narrow and you're up to the challenge of an annoying map). That's why the '!nextmap'
<a href="chatting.html">command</a> is there.</p>

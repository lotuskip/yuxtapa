<h2>Strategy guide</h2>

<p>To be a really good player, you really need to figure these things out for
yourself through experience <em>and</em> go beyond these rules of thumb. Be
cunning.</p>

<h3>Playing with each class</h3>
<p><a href="archer.html">Archer:</a>
Try to stay close to a melee-capable teammate who
can protect you while you shoot. If such is not available, flee from melee.
It's often best <em>not</em> to use your torch, but to shoot from the dark into
the light. Try to get to positions that are easily defended (protected by
chasm/water/rough terrain) or allow for a sure-hit line of fire (end of a narrow
corridor). Trees are a nuisance only if they are further away from you; prefer
to shoot <em>from among</em> trees as opposed to <em>into</em> trees.
</p>

<p><a href="assassin.html">Assassin:</a>
Consider collaborating with scouts: they reveal the enemy so you know when it is
safe to move without being spotted. Try to take advantage of light traps.
</p>

<p><a href="combatmage.html">Combat mage:</a>
Zaps are effective in narrow spaces and in close range (often it's better to zap than
to melee). When sure that teammates are behind your back, feel free to zap
blindly at where you think the enemy might be. Remember that zaps travel both
faster and further when they are bouncing off of walls. Beware of archers who easily ward
off your zaps, wizards who have a good chance of resisting them, and other combat
magi who have both of these traits.
</p>

<p><a href="fighter.html">Fighter:</a>
You can succesfully melee anyone. Incomplete circle strikes are often better
than normal melee, except against high-DV opponents (assassins and archers). Be
extra careful with spellcasters: wizards in open spaces and combat magi in
close range.
</p>

<p><a href="healer.html">Healer:</a>
Poison and run &mdash; you can't win in melee except by getting lucky. If you're
hit and survive, heal up as soon as possible. Help out teammates instead of
soloing.
</p>

<p><a href="mindcrafter.html">Mindcrafer:</a>
A hard-to-define class. The special ability is certainly not the
&quot;point&quot; of this class. Good for scouting and melee, particularly
against spellcasters. Keep in mind that you can blink to anywhere you can
<em>see</em>, in particular, through otherwise unpassable windows.
</p>

<p><a href="miner.html">Miner:</a>
Strong in melee and weak against spellcasters just like fighters. The special
ability is absolutely crucial and should be used a lot. If there is no need to
mine passages or to build bridges, there is no point playing a miner.
</p>

<p><a href="scout.html">Scout:</a>
Always do scouting, don't bother with anything else. <em>Scouting</em>
specifically means pointing out enemies and detecting traps. Collaborate with archers
and assassins. Don't drop a disguise without a good reason.
</p>

<p><a href="trapper.html">Trapper:</a>
Trap all critical pathways, but in case the area is not lit, leave a safe
passage for teammates to walk without risk. Also detect and disarm enemy traps.
Even though not terrible in melee, using a trapper for that would be a waste.
With their hiding in trees ability they make good scout replacements in outdoor
maps.
</p>

<p><a href="wizard.html">Wizard:</a>
In narrow and curvy passages don't even bother doing anything besides offering a
light. Stay in open spaces, passages surrounded by chasm or water are the best.
Outdoors, avoid forests, as the trees can unexpectedly absorb your missiles.
</p>

<p><a href="planewalker.html">Planewalker:</a>
Use for quickly scouting the territory, particularly useful for spotting
objective-related objects like boulders in destroy mode and the item in steal
mode. Communicate with miners. Also spy what the enemy is up to and tell your
teammates. There is often no reason to move from the initial spawn flag.
</p>


<h3>Dealing with each class</h3>
<p><a href="archer.html">Archer:</a> spells or backstab are the best, melee
works too if your own class has good tohit. Use corners and boulders for cover, or trees
if nothing else is available.</p>

<p><a href="assassin.html">Assassin:</a> magic missiles are great (they both
spot and often kill assassins for you).</p>

<p><a href="combatmage.html">Combat mage:</a> backstab or arrows, or outnumber
them in melee.</p>

<p><a href="fighter.html">Fighter:</a> spells.</p>

<p><a href="healer.html">Healer:</a> anything besides magic missiles and arrows,
since they usually can survive these and heal up. Make sure you have a friendly
healer around to heal you in case you're poisoned.</p>

<p><a href="wizard.html">Wizard:</a> if the magic missiles give you
trouble, just run around in zig-zag making them hit each other, or flee into
some trees.</p>

<h3>Advanced team cooperation</h3>
<p>On a large map with a conveniently located boulder source, a team (typically
the purple team in conquest or steal mode) can organise to build fortifications out
of boulders. A line of two boulders is inpassable without miners or
mindcrafters. Combine with the use of boobytraps.</p>

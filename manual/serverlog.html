<h2>Server log</h2>

<p>The yuxtapa server will write a log file 'server.log' into the config
directory (typically /home/user/.config/yuxtapa/). The file contains
various information that can be of use or of interest to the server
administrator.</p>

<p>The file is created if it is missing and new log entries are appended
to an existing file.</p>

<p>The best way to get acquainted with the log is to run a server for
a while and then take a look at the log. A few points of particular
interest are mentioned here:</p>

<h3>Usage reports</h3>

<p>Every half hour, the server reports the current number of connected players
if it is not zero. An entry is also printed when the last player leaves.
This can be used to construct a (graphical, if you wish)
representation of the server usage. (If anyone feels like writing
a script to do this, feel free to contribute!)</p>

<p>The average presence is also printed upon server shutdown, and for
each day, at midnight. (That's the new average since the average
was last printed, not overall.)</p>

<h3>Warnings in the log</h3>

<p>The server can sometimes write warnings into the log. These <em>usually</em>
indicate that the server settings might need some adjusting. Most
common causes of warnings are:
<dl>
<dt>map size had to be enlarged due to too high number of players</dt>
<dd>Indicates that you <em>might</em> want to either make the mapsize
variable larger or limit the maximum number of players. This warning
can be safely ignored, though, if you wish to play with small maps
when there are only a few players.</dd>
<dt>the server lagged so-and-so many turns during a map</dt>
<dd>This indicates that the server cannot keep up with all what's
going on. If the number of turns lagged is very small and the warnings
only occur occasionally, it's probably all right (perhaps you have some
other processes running on the same computer that occasionally eat some
processor time?). But if the lagging is great and constant, you should
(A) limit the maximum number of players, or, which is more effective,
(B) increase the turnms value. The latter greatly affects the general
feel of the gameplay, so use it as a last resort. Disabling <a href="bots.html">bots</a>,
if they are used, probably also helps.</dd>
<dt>&quot;Incompatible child connection.&quot;</dt>
<dd>This is printed when what the server thinks is a bot tries to connect but reports an invalid version number.
Check is that your Mr. Brown is up to date! If your bots are disabled, this message
appearing implies something weird...</dd>

<h2>Movement</h2>

<p>
Players familiar with roguelike games should have no trouble adjusting to the
basic movement method of yuxtapa. By default, you move using the numpad keys 1-4 and 6-9:
<pre>
7: up-left     8: up     9: up-right

4: left        @ (you)   6: right

1: down-left   2: down   3: down-right
</pre>
</p>

<p>You can walk on anything except
<ul>
<li>walls and windows ('#', '|', '-')</li>
<li>closed doors ('+'); although walking at them will open them</li>
<li>other players ('@') and boulders ('O')</li>
</ul></p>

<p>Many actions are triggered simply by moving: to enter a portal you just walk
into it; to attack someone you simply <em>walk at them</em>, etc.</p>

<p>Due to the real-timedness, there are some peculiarities that players of
roguelikes probably are not used to. These are explained later on this page.</p>


<h3>Terrain</h3>

<p>Walking on most tiles takes one turn per step. However, marsh (green '&quot;')
and rough terrain (dark ';') are slower to walk on, and you lose one turn after
stepping on such tiles (unless your class is <a href="trapper.html">Trapper</a> or <a href="scout.html">Scout</a>).</p>

<p>Some terrains are dangerous to walk on. Water terrain (blue '~') can cause drowning
damage, and walking into a chasm (just emptiness: ' ') will instantly kill you.</p>

<p>It is possible to <strong>swim</strong> through water without drowning. This, however,
requires good timing. The details are explained in <a href="rulemech.html">Rule mechanics</a>.
Stepping on water squares makes noise unless your class is <a href="scout.html">Scout</a> or
<a href="assassin.html">Assassin</a>.</p>


<h3>Walking mode</h3>
<p>You can press 'w' to toggle the so-called <em>walking mode</em>. Many roguelikes
have a feature with a similar name, but in yuxtapa it's different.</p>

<p>When you take a step in walking mode (with 1-4, 6-9), then, until you do
something else, this same step in the same direction is repeated over
and over again. So, if you hit 'w' to toggle walking mode on, then hit '8'
to move up, and just wait doing nothing, your character will walk up
one step per turn. <em>Until you do something</em>, there is <em>absolutely</em> no condition
to <em>automatically</em> stop. Also, the direction does not change; the walking
mode will not steer you along a corridor like in many roguelikes.</p>

<p>To stop without turning off the walking mode, press '5' (default keybinding).</p>

<p>The purpose of the walking mode is mainly to ease the stress that yuxtapa
causes on your keyboard. If nothing is going on and you need to walk
long distances, it's nicer to do in walking mode: you only have to hit
a key to <em>turn</em>, not to explicitly take each step.</p>

<p>The walking mode is also very nice when <a href="spectating.html">Spectating</a>, since you can
go through walls. Although note that when spectating it's also possible
to take more than one steps per turn, and this might be preferable
to cross long distances (walking mode only walks one step per turn).</p>


<h3>Swapping places with teammates</h3>
<p>It often happens that you are in a narrow corridor with a teammate.
In roguelikes, you can usually swap places with nonhostiles without
any trouble, but in yuxtapa such behaviour would cause problems (to
understand why, read the page <a href="timesystem.html">Time system</a>).</p>

<p>Roughly speaking, the rules are these:</p>

<p>If you walk at a teammate and that teammate moves away on the same
turn, you will occupy her place:
<pre>
#####   both hit '6'  #####
.@@..      ---&gt;       ..@@.
#####                 #####
 AB                     AB
</pre>
If the teammate is walking at you on the same turn, you swap places:
<pre>
   ...   A hits '2'   ...
A-&gt;.@.      ---&gt;      .@.&lt;-B
B-&gt;.@.   B hits '8'   .@.&lt;-A
   ...                ...
</pre>
If the teammate hasn't acted for 8 turns (on normal settings that's
2 seconds), only your move is necessary to cause a swap. This means
that your teammate's PC moves even though she didn't mean that to
happen, and might have nasty consequences (if, e.g. your teammate is
a <a href="combatmage.html">Combat mage</a> about to cast a spell).</p>

<p>Otherwise you cannot swap places with a teammate. Go around if there's
room, and if there isn't and if they don't seem to notice, you can
<a href="chatting.html">yell</a>. Also, look things the other way
and be courteous to teammates who might want to pass <em>you</em> in a
tight spot.</p>

<p>Observe that when swapping places, actions that usually are caused by
movement are not always taken. Roughly speaking, besides moving, the
<em>passive party</em> in the swap won't do anything she didn't intend to do.</p>

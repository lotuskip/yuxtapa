<h2>Questions and answers</h2>

<p>..and comments and replies.</p>

<h3>Apparent bugs and similar problems</h3>
<dl>
<dt><em>The game looks horrible, nothing like the screenshots!</em></dt>
<dd>See <a href="terminals.html">Terminals</a>.</dd>

<dt><em>The game is sluggish!</em></dt>
<dd>Probably it isn't. It just functions in discrete time, see <a href="timesystem.html">Time system</a>.
It takes a little bit of getting used to to get 'into the rhythm'. (If you still
insist that the game is sluggish, take a look at the indicator animation: if it
runs smoothly (evenly), it's not a question of the game being sluggish but the
player being impatient and 'not in the rhythm'.)</dd>

<dt><em>Some classes/abilities are overpowered/useless!</em></dt>
<dd>Probably true. Tell the author which ones and how and, if you can, suggest how to
fix this.</dd>

<dt><em>Why is the equivalent of green <strong>teal</strong> in the 16 colour mode?</em></dt>
<dd>Not the equivalent of green in general, just of the green team. It seemed like it would give an unfair benefit
to the green team if their PCs were the same colour as the ground&amp;trees&amp;marsh as if camoflauged.</dd>

<dt><em>Water traps rust weapons but swimming in water doesn't. WTF?</em></dt>
<dd>If you go into water, you know you're going into water and can protect your weapon from getting wet. Water traps come as
a surprise to the PC (or are intentionally triggered, which would be somewhat silly).</dd>

<dt><em>The class limit settings is not working! I'm not allowed to become an archer even though there are 0 archers in my team!</em></dt>
<dd>The class limit setting checks against the <em>next</em> class, not the current. So there must be several people on your team who
have decided to become an archer before you did, but are still alive or in the limbo. The classes they are <em>currently</em> playing
should be available for picking.</dd>

<dt><em>There is a PC in my view whose title I can't see! Nothing is printed even though titles are on!</em></dt>
<dd>That would be an enemy outside of your LOS, revealed to you by a friendly scout. They don't have titles; you just know 'there is an enemy there'.</dd>

<dt><em>I found a bug!</em></dt>
<dd>Good! <a href="bugs.html">'Call upon the author to explain!'</a></dd>

<dt><em>There was an inaccessible location generated. That sucks.</em></dt>
<dd>Some places <em>are</em> inaccessible, that's why we have the word 'inaccessible'. If it is beyond the reach of both
miners and mindcrafters <strong>and</strong> you really do need to get there (or out of there), then that's a problem (see the
discussion at the bottom of <a href="maptypes.html">this page</a>). Otherwise, consider it a challenge.</dd>
</dl>

<h3>Server issues</h3>
<dl>
<dt><em>No one can connect to my server!</em></dt>
<dd>It might be a firewall issue. In your firewall configuration, enable UDP through the port that you
defined in your <em>server.conf</em> file. See your distro-specific documentation for more info.</dd>

<dt><em>I am getting a message about someone using my ID on the server and cannot connect!</em></dt>
<dd>This should be extremely rare. If it happens often, something is wrong (a bug?). However, the remedy
is to remove the line corresponding to this server from the 'servers' file in the config directory
and reconnect. This will lose your stats on that server, sadly.</dd>

<dt><em>I forgot to make myself super-admin and now some jack-ass has hijacked my server!</em></dt>
<dd>Shutdown the server and delete the file '.playerdata' in the config dir. Then try again.</dd>

<dt><em>How do I shutdown a server that is running on a remove machine?</em></dt>
<dd>Send a SIGINT to the process through ssh: 'killall -INT yuxtapa_sv'</dd>

<dt><em>The server won't start up, it says: &quot;Failed to bind socket!&quot;</em></dt>
<dd>Do you have one server instance running already? Or did a previous instance shut down uncleanly while bots were active?
Do 'killall yuxtapa_sv' and/or 'killall [bot executable name]' and try again.</dd>

</dl>


<h3>Common requests for enchantments</h3>
<dl>
<dt><em>How about a feature to restart the current map?</em></dt>
<dd>Nah. What you can do is store the map (!storemap temp) and play it again (!nextmap temp). This will only recall the terrain, though, everything else
might be changed (objective, flag placement, etc.)</dd>
<dt><em>Is there no way to see what classes your teammates are playing?</em></dt>
<dd>Since version 10 there is! The key for this is 'i'. The 'd' key might also
come in handy in some situations.</dd>
<dt><em>How about some sort of a voting system?</em></dt>
<dd>You don't need the computer's assistance to practise democracy.</dd>

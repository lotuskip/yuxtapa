<h2>Healer</h2>

<p>pros: very useful abilities<br>
cons: weak, bad in melee, short LOS-radius</p>

<h3>Abilities</h3>
<ul>
<li>Heal temmates or self</li>
<li>Poison opponents</li>
</ul>

<p>To use the abilities
<ul>
<li>press space</li>
<li>hit a direction key to heal a neighbour in that direction</li>
<ul>
<li>you cannot heal enemies; instead you <em>poison</em> them</li>
<li>you can heal yourself by entering '5' as the direction</li>
</ul>
</ul></p>

<p>Healing always restores a single hitpoint.</p>

<p>A <em>poisoned</em> enemy takes 1 point of damage every 40 turns
(10 seconds on normal settings). When a healer heals someone,
that someone's poisoned-status is removed, as well. Otherwise,
it won't disappear on its own until the victim dies.</p>

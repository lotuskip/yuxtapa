<h2>Cheating</h2>

<p>No, this page does not teach you how to cheat.</p>

<p>There is one point in the game logic that takes place in the client end, thus
giving the opportunity to 'cheat'. This point is archery. Since yuxtapa is open-source,
it is not unthinkable that some player with programming skills would modify her client
so as to make archery easier or more efficient.</p>

<p>There is little you can do against this kind of behaviour in an open source
game, and in yuxtapa, not even an attempt is made. If someone rewrites their
client so that they can, for instance, aim their arrows with the mouse,
they can do that, but they should be kicked, banned, and loathed by others.</p>

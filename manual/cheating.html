<h2>Cheating</h2>

<p>No, this page does not teach you how to cheat.</p>

<p>Since yuxtapa is open source and certain limiting procedures take place
only at the client end, it is not unthinkable that some player with
programming skills would modify his client so as to make playing
easier. (In particular the behaviour of the special abilities of
<a href="archer.html">archers</a>, <a href="combatmage.html">combat magi</a> and
<a href="wizard.html">wizards</a> are liable to this.)</p>

<p>There is little you can do against this kind of behaviour in an open source
game, and in yuxtapa, not even an attempt is made. If someone rewrites their
client so that 'z' casts a zap, 'm' casts a magic missile, and they can
aim their arrows with the mouse, they can do that, but they should be kicked,
banned, and loathed by others.</p>

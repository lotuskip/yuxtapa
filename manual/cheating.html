<h2>Cheating</h2>

<p>No, this page does not teach you how to cheat. It might give some evil people ideas,
but hopefully it will also increase the awareness of good server admins.</p>

<p>There is one restrictive point in the game logic that takes place in the client end, thus
giving the opportunity to 'cheat'. This point is archery. Since yuxtapa is open-source,
it is not unthinkable that some player with programming skills would modify her client
so as to make archery easier or more efficient.</p>

<p>Someone might also modify their client to <em>record</em> the view so they wouldn't need to
<em>remember</em> that much of the map themselves. They could also try to combine information
received as a spectator into this illegit record.</p>

<p>There is little you can do against this kind of behaviour in an open source
game, and in yuxtapa, not even an attempt is made. If someone rewrites their
client so that they can, for instance, aim their arrows with the mouse,
they can do that, but they should be kicked, banned, and loathed by others.</p>

<h2>Server configuration</h2>

<p>The server configuration file is read similarly as the <a href="clientconf.html">Client configuration</a>
file, and general things mentioned on that page are not repeated here.</p>

<p>Like with the client configuration, the template for the server configuration file 'server.conf'
is well commented, and documents itself. Here we just say a few words about map generation:</p>


<h3>Map generation</h3>
<p>The map is a square of 'mapsize'x'mapsize' tiles (a tile is one symbol on the screen).
yuxtapa generates random maps; you cannot have 'designed' maps like in many other
multiplayer games.</p>

<p>The variable <strong>mapsizevar</strong> is used to slighly randomise the size. It is interpreted
as a percentage of the base mapsize given in the config. So, for instance, if your config has
<pre>
mapsize 100
mapsizevar 10
</pre>
then the generated maps will be 90-110 tiles wide and tall (but always square). A new random
size is determined for each new map during the intermission.</p>

<p>There is another limitation, forced upon generation of a new map: the final mapsize
sqrt(num of players)*10 to ensure sufficient spawning space. This extra limitation might
make the map larger than specified by the config, but never smaller.</p>


<h3>General about running a yuxtapa server</h3>
<p>yuxtapa is designed to follow an architecture where the server 'does all the work' and
the client only works as an interpreter between the player and the server. This has
certain advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>easier development; (most) mutable functionality is restricted to one end of the system</li>
<li>harder to cheat; clients have very little power over things</li>
<li>less fuzz with updates; usually old versions of the client will function with the newest server</li>
</ul>
and it has one major disadvantage:
<ul>
<li>the server can get really busy</li>
</ul>
This is because the server, for instance, <em>renders the views</em> for all the players.
(Okay, rendering a view in yuxtapa is not the same as rendering a 3D world in an FPS game,
but with 50+ players it can be a considerable workload.)</p>

<p>It is often asked what kind of a connection the server needs. A rough formula, assuming
you follow the default 'pace' of 250ms per turn, is
<blockquote>[TODO] kb/s out</blockquote>
where N is the number of connected players. This is the value during gameplay, and has
been obtained <em>partially</em> through testing, partially through theoretical computation.
There can be occasional peaks and variation (if lots of new players connect or if the
players chat a lot). Incoming network traffic to the server is much smaller, insignificant
compared to the out-going amount.</p>

<h2>Spectating</h2>

<p>Spectators are players who do not partake in the game as members of either team. They have no
player characters and are not visible in the game in any way. They merely observe what is happening
and can comment the events in the chat. You can also become a spectator if you need to take a break
from playing but do not wish to disconnect from the server.</p>

<p>Spectators can move around as <em>free spectators</em>, or follow playing players. Free spectators
can be thought of as floating 'cameras' that the spectator can move just like she would move her PC
while playing. The spectator movement is not restricted by the <a href="timesystem.html">Time system</a>,
and free spectators can move their view through walls and other obstacles.</p>

<p>If a spectator hits <strong>space</strong> (or the respective remapped key), they will start following
a player. They see the view of that player just like the player herself does (only the view, not the PC
info or anything else), and they cannot move the view anymore.</p>

<p>You can hit space again to switch whom to follow. If nothing seems
to happen, then there are no players to follow. Pressing space repeatedly cycles through all the followable players,
until it returns back to yourself, the free spectator.</p>

<p>If you wish to 'hop off' of a followed view and continue as a free spectator <em>in that part of the map</em>,
you can do so by 're-becoming a spectator' in the <a href="limbo.html">limbo menu</a>.</p>

<p>If the player you are following dies, you are automatically made a free spectator, just as if you had
'hopped off'.</p>


<h3>Spectating when dead</h3>
<p>If you are not a spectator but a playing player, and you happen to die, you temporarily become what could be
called a <em>team-bound spectator</em>. You cannot move around as a free spectator, but your 'free spectating' is
restricted to a static view of the place where you died. You can, however, hit space to follow your teammates
(those of them who are alive). When you spawn, any following
is automatically interrupted and you are transferred back into playing.</p>

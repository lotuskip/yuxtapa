<h2>Spectating</h2>

<p>...</p>

<p>You can hit <strong>space</strong> (or the respective remapped key) to switch whom to follow. If nothing seems
to happen, then there are no players to follow. Pressing space repeatedly cycles through all the followable players,
until it returns back to yourself, the free spectator.</p>

<p>If you wish to 'hop off' of a followed view and continue as a free spectator <em>in that part of the map</em>,
you can do so by 're-becoming a spectator' in the <a href="limbo.html">limbo menu</a>.</p>

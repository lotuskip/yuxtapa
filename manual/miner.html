<h2>Miner</h2>

<p>pros: very high HP, high damage, high PV<br>
cons: no torch, short LOS-radius, low DV, no magic resistance</p>

<h3>Abilities</h3>
<ul>
<li>Dig through walls</li>
<li>Destroy boulders</li>
<li>Carve new boulders</li>
<li>can push boulders</li>
</ul>

<p>To dig through a wall, stand next to it, hit space, and then hit the direction
to dig into (which should be a wall square). Digging a wall takes a while, makes noise,
and if you move before you're finished, you have to start over again (you'll know you're done
when the wall disappears, obviously).</p>

<p>Note that digging the outer wall surrounding the map is impossible.</p>

<p>Miners can also destroy boulders (see <a href="objects.html">Objects in the game</a>) by digging
them. The boulder needs to be 'blocked' for this to happen (i.e. it must not
be pushable from the direction of the digging).</p>

<p>This latter ability can make miners irreplacable in a game where
the objective is to destroy boulders. Sometimes some parts of a map &mdash; even
an initial spawn point &mdash; might be inaccessible without a miner to mine
a way out.</p>

<p>Finally, Miners can carve new boulders from a <em>boulder source</em> (see
<a href="objects.html">Objects in the game</a>). Stand next to the boulder source, hit space,
and 'dig into the boulder source'.</p>

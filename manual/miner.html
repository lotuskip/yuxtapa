<h2>Miner</h2>

<p>pros: very high HP, high damage, high PV<br>
cons: no torch, short LOS-radius, low DV, no magic resistance</p>

<h3>Abilities</h3>
<ul>
<li>Dig through walls/windows/doors</li>
<li>Destroy boulders</li>
<li>Carve new boulders</li>
<li>Can push boulders</li>
</ul>

<p>To dig through a wall, stand next to it, hit space, and then hit the direction
to dig into (which should be a wall square). Digging a wall takes a while, makes noise,
and if you move before you're finished, you have to start over again (you'll know you're done
when the wall disappears, obviously).</p>

<p>Some walls are so hard that you can't dig through them. Such walls, however, cannot be distinguished
by regular diggable walls in any other way except by trying to dig and failing. The outer wall
surrounding the map is always undiggable.</p>

<p>You can also dig through windows and closed doors.</p>

<p>Miners can also destroy boulders (see <a href="objects.html">Objects in the game</a>) by digging
them. The boulder needs to be 'blocked' for this to happen (i.e. it must not
be pushable from the direction of the digging).
This ability can make miners irreplacable in a game where
the objective is to destroy boulders. Sometimes some parts of a map &mdash; even
an initial spawn point &mdash; might be inaccessible without a miner to mine
a way out.</p>

<p>Finally, Miners can carve new boulders from a <em>boulder source</em> (see
<a href="objects.html">Objects in the game</a>). Stand next to the boulder source, hit space,
and 'dig into the boulder source'.</p>

<h2>Intermission</h2>

<p>A yuxtapa server alternates between two <em>phases</em>: the <em>game phase</em>, during which the
actual playing happends, and an <em>intermission</em>. After each intermission,
the played map, and possibly the objective, are changed.</p>

<p>During the intermission, the server shows a condensed image of the next map
and a list of the current players, and the players can take a break. The
intermission's length is determined in the <a href="serverconf.html">Server configuration</a>. Chatting,
switching team and changing class are all possible during the intermission,
just like in the game phase.</p>

<h2>Intermission</h2>

<p>A yuxtapa server alternates between two <em>phases</em>: the <em>game phase</em>, during which the
actual playing happends, and an <em>intermission</em>. After each intermission,
the played map, and possibly the objective, are changed.</p>

<p>During the intermission, the server shows a condensed image of the next map
and a list of the current players, and the players can take a break. The length of the
intermission is determined in the <a href="serverconf.html">Server configuration</a>. Chatting,
switching team and changing class are all possible during the intermission,
just like in the game phase.</p>

<p>Turning the titles (see <a href="vision.html">Vision and hearing</a>) on during the intermission will
view the objective of the next map (see <a href="gametypes.html">Game types</a>); the objective viewn in
the normal place in the upper left corner is the objective (and result) of the previous map.</p>

<p><em>The update animation does not run during intermission!</em> So worry not, your connection to the
server is (probably) fine.</p>

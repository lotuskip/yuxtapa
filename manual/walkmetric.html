<h2>Walk metric</h2>

<p>Distances in yuxtapa are often considered in the so-called 'walk metric', i.e., how
many steps it takes to walk from a point to point. Since diagonal steps can be taken,
this makes the field of vision seemingly a square, but in fact it is a circle
in the walk metric!</p>

<p>In fact, the often seen 'round' field of vision of many
roguelikes is quite odd: it looks seemingly right, but it has the semi-hidden
effect that you see further away in non-diagonal directions!</p>

<p>What intuitively looks more or less round, eg.:
<pre>
    ***
   *   *
  *     *
 *       *
 *   C   *A
 *       *
  *     *
   *   *B
    ***</pre>
actually looks, when translated into the normal Euclidian metric, something like this:<br>

(Consider the <em>distance</em> between the points 'C', 'A', and 'B'.)</p>

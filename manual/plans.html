<h2>Planned Features</h2>

<p>On this page are listed a number of ideas that might be implemented into some future release of yuxtapa.
You are welcome to contribute new ideas or comment on these. Nothing major is going to happen, though.</p>

<p>Things that probably will appear in the next release, already:
<ol>
<li>improvements with the map generation (more variety, more logic)</li>
<li>trappers can also disarm traps</li>
<li>adjustments, adjustments, adjustments &mdash; please send suggestions</li>
</ol></p>

<p>Later plans that need further specification and perhaps more thinking:</p>
<p><strong>Game features&amp;rules related:</strong>
<ol>
<li>more mining abilities (these make sense but might make miners too 'all-purpose'):
<ul>
<li>breaking windows just like walls (and even faster)</li>
<li>destroying closed doors completely by digging into them</li>
<li>destroying static torches similarly</li>
<li>clearing rough terrain</li>
</ul></li>
<li>to counter-balance that: make some walls undiggable (would look like regular walls but just not break)?</li>
<li>fireballs light carried torches (a minor detail, but could be a nice touch?)</li>
<li>acid traps (much like boobytrap, but doesn't vanish once triggered) (could call them something else, too; 'acid trap' comes from ADOM)</li>
<li>illusory walls (walk-through but not see-through tiles)</li>
<li>some kind of <em>mind's eye</em> type ability that would leave the PC standing vulnerable, but would allow moving the viewpoint
quickly just like a spectator's (perhaps a new class for this?)</li>
<li>new game modes; got suggestions?</li>
</ol>
<strong>Metagaming&amp;interface related:</strong>
<ol>
<li>Some behavioural client-end settings; for instance:
<ul>
<li>A setting to have an automatic shout generated if you are damaged (should be quickly toggleable on/off, and have an initial value defined in the
config)i; note that the server prevents <em>dead</em> PCs from shouting, so single-hit kills would be silent</li>
<li>'quick-shouts': some single key, the pressing of which generates a pre-defined shout, without the player having to type anything</li>
</ul></li>
<li>more statistics:
<ul>
<li>number of team kills</li>
<li>stat kills according to the method of killing (see <a href="waystodie.html">ways to die</a>)</li>
<li>suggestions?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>smarter, more advanced chat aliasing (suggestions?)</li>
<li>possibility to remap the keys in a more advanced fashion (eg. to use Ctrl&amp;Alt + key)</li>
<li>use the space under the team info in the <a href="clientscreen.html">client screen</a> for something significant; examples:
<ul>
<li>more in-game info, such as locations of flags belonging to own team</li>
<li>some info generated locally at the client end (like connection statistics)</li>
<li>some kind of longer message defined by the owner of the server (like &quot;my server rules: ...&quot;)</li>
<li>instead expand the message box upwards (and the <em>PC info etc.</em>, too, which then would perhaps need some more content)</li>
<li>or put the <em>PC info etc.</em> in the now-empty space and widen the message box?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>possibility to save the currently played map with a given name into a file and load a previously saved map to play (if the game happens to
generate an awesome map, you wouldn't lose it; e.g. &quot;!storemap coolmap&quot;, &quot;!nextmap coolmap&quot;)</li>
<li>an actual AI for the bots</li>
<li>optional sound effects in the client end? (in addition to the visual '!'s you could actually <em>hear</em> a sound)</li>
</ol></p>

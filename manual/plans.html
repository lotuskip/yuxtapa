<h2>Planned Features</h2>

<p>On this page are listed a number of ideas that might be implemented into some future release of yuxtapa.
You are welcome to contribute new ideas or comment on these. Nothing major is going to happen, though.</p>

<p><strong>Game features&amp;rules related:</strong>
<ol>
<li>more mining abilities:
<ul>
<li>destroying closed doors by digging into them</li>
<li>turning floor into rough terrain (not always succesful, a chance of creating a chasm in dungeons, ...)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>illusory walls (walk-through but not see-through tiles)</li>
<li>maybe take the <a href="facing.html">facing</a> variable into account more often (like divide attacks to frontal/flank/rear and adjust DV
correspondingly)? This would be something you could turn on in the server config; players who dislike it could run 'old-school' servers where it's turned
off.</li>
<li>new game modes; got suggestions?</li>
</ol>
<strong>Metagaming&amp;interface related:</strong>
<ol>
<li>smarter, more advanced chat aliasing (suggestions?)</li>
<li>make the static entities (flags, torches, boulders, portals etc.) part of the stored maps (a nice idea but appears to demand a lot of rethinking and
work &mdash; this was never <em>planned!</em>)</li>
<li>an actual AI for the bots</li>
<li>optional sound effects in the client end? (in addition to the visual '!'s you could actually <em>hear</em> a sound)</li>
</ol></p>

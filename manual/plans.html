<h2>Planned Features</h2>

<p>On this page are listed a number of ideas that might be implemented into some future release of yuxtapa.
You are welcome to contribute new ideas or comment on these. Nothing major is going to happen, though.</p>

<ol>
<li>trappers can also disarm traps</li>
<li>more mining abilities (these make sense but might make miners too 'all-purpose'):
<ul>
<li>breaking windows just like walls (and even faster)</li>
<li>destroying closed doors completely by digging into them</li>
<li>destroying static torches similarly</li>
<li>clearing rough terrain</li>
</ul></li>
<li>to counter-balance that: make some walls undiggable (would look like regular walls but just not break)?</li>
<li>fireballs light carried torches (a minor detail, but could be a nice touch?)</li>
<li>acid traps (much like boobytrap, but doesn't vanish once triggered)</li>
<li>illusory walls (walk-through but not see-through tiles)</li>
<li>more statistics:
<ul>
<li>number of team kills</li>
<li>stat kills according to the method of killing (see <a href="waystodie.html">ways to die</a>)</li>
<li>suggestions?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>some kind of <em>mind's eye</em> type ability that would leave the PC standing vulnerable, but would allow moving the viewpoint
quickly just like a spectator's (perhaps a new class for this?)</li>
<li>possibility to save the currently played map with a given name into a file and load a previously saved map to play (if the game happens to
generate an awesome map, you wouldn't lose it; e.g. &quot;!storemap coolmap&quot;, &quot;!nextmap coolmap&quot;)</li>
<li>make chatting more user-friendly:
<ul>
<li>possibility to scroll previously entered strings with up/down arrow keys</li>
<li>smarter aliasing in the config (suggestions?)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>should spectators see not only the view of the followed player but also their PC info and the messages that are currently sent only to them?</li>
<li>an actual AI for the bots</li>
<li>new game modes?</li>
<li>optional sound effects in the client end? (in addition to the visual '!'s you could actually <em>hear</em> a sound)</li>
</ol>

<h2>Planned Features</h2>

<p>On this page are listed a number of ideas that might be implemented into some future release of yuxtapa.
You are welcome to contribute new ideas or comment on these. Nothing major is going to happen, though.</p>

<p><strong>Game features&amp;rules related:</strong>
<ol>
<li>more mining abilities:
<ul>
<li>breaking windows just like walls (might even consider it a bug that you <em>can't</em>)</li>
<li>destroying closed doors by digging into them</li>
<li>turning floor into rough terrain (not always succesful, a chance of creating a chasm in dungeons, ...)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>acid traps (much like boobytrap, but doesn't vanish once triggered) (could call them something else, too; 'acid trap' comes from ADOM)</li>
<li>arrows hitting traps could make them go off? (really relevant only with boobytraps and fireballs)</li>
<li>illusory walls (walk-through but not see-through tiles)</li>
<li>some kind of <em>mind's eye</em> type ability that would leave the PC standing vulnerable, but would allow moving the viewpoint
quickly just like a spectator's (a new class for this)</li>
<li>maybe take the <a href="facing.html">facing</a> variable into account more often (like divide attacks to frontal/flank/rear and adjust DV
correspondingly)? This would be something you could turn on in the server config; players who dislike it could run 'old-school' servers where it's turned
off.</li>
<li>a new map type, 'indoor', which would be more architectural, less fractal/messy, but still randomly generated</li>
<li>new game modes; got suggestions?</li>
</ol>
<strong>Metagaming&amp;interface related:</strong>
<ol>
<li>new server commands: <em>!putteam</em> and <em>!setclass</em> (for admins)</li>
<li>more statistics:
<ul>
<li>number of team kills</li>
<li>record kills according to the method of killing (see <a href="waystodie.html">ways to die</a>)</li>
<li>&quot;killing sprees&quot; and notification of them (could be turned off in the server config)</li>
<li>suggestions?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>smarter, more advanced chat aliasing (suggestions?)</li>
<li>use the space under the team info in the <a href="clientscreen.html">client screen</a> for something significant; examples:
<ul>
<li>more in-game info, such as locations of flags belonging to own team</li>
<li>some info generated locally at the client end (like connection statistics)</li>
<li>some kind of longer message defined by the owner of the server (like &quot;my server rules: ...&quot;)</li>
<li>instead expand the message box upwards (and the <em>PC info etc.</em>, too, which then would perhaps need some more content)</li>
<li>or put the <em>PC info etc.</em> in the now-empty space and widen the message box?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>new map format that is directly editable with a text editor</li>
<li>make the static entities (flags, torches, boulders, portals etc.) part of the stored maps (a nice idea but appears to demand a lot of rethinking and
work &mdash; this was never <em>planned!</em>)</li>
<li>an actual AI for the bots</li>
<li>optional sound effects in the client end? (in addition to the visual '!'s you could actually <em>hear</em> a sound)</li>
</ol></p>

<h2>Bots</h2>

<p>The yuxtapa bots are called <em>Mr. Browns</em>. Their AI is primitive, but growing piecemeal.
It will never be really awesome, since this is not an experiment in AI theory.</p>

<p>Admins (see <a href="adminlevels.html">Admin levels</a>) can spawn Mr. Browns in-game (see
<a href="chatting.html">Chatting and shouting</a>). There is also a command for dropping all the bots.
All of this requires that the server admin has setup the bots properly, see <a href="serverconf.html">server configuration</a>.</p>

<p>The bots will automatically join a team, and do their best to be useful, which so far is not much.</p>

<p>Spawning several bots can introduce a significant momentary delay as all the bot processes are initiated.
Also, the server machine now has to run not only the server but all the bots; drop the bots if it seems that they
cause the server to lose 'frames'. At the moment this is unlikely, but might become an issue if a more complicated AI
is written for the bots one day.</p>

<p>If the server is full and new players try to connect, bots, if there are any, are automatically dropped to make room.</p>


<h3>Installing Mr. Brown</h3>
<p>For AUR users: the bot executable, named 'mrbrown', is placed in /usr/share/yuxtapa. The rest is for others:</p>

<p>At least at the moment, the bot executable is not built along with the server and the client, but
you must compile it separately with
<pre>
make mrbrown
</pre>
If at some point the bots become widely <em>useful</em> and <em>desirable</em>,
they will be added to the release as a third component, just like the client and the server are now.</p>

<p>The above make call should build an executable called 'mrbrown' in the 'yuxtapa' parent directory. You can move this executable
to some accessible directory (such as '/usr/bin'), but the important thing is that you point the server
configuration to it (see the server configuration file).</p>

<p>After this, bots should be runnable from within the game. They can also be executed stand-alone (but
most people probably don't want this). You can check the version of the bot client with
<pre>
mrbrown -v
</pre></p>

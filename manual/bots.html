<h2>Bots</h2>

<p>At the moment, there are no real, competitive bots in yuxtapa. What there are
are <em>Mr. Browns</em>.</p>

<p>Mr. Browns are bot programs that function like bots in many other multiplayer
games, but don't have any kind of AI. They just move around randomly (hence
the name).</p>

<p>What are they good for? Well...
<ul>
<li>Testing. The main reason they were introduced was that there were not enough people to test multiplaying otherwise.</li>
<li>Target practise. It can actually be difficult to beat them in melee.</li>
</ul></p>

<p>Admins (see <a href="adminlevels.html">Admin levels</a>) can spawn Mr. Browns in-game with the command '!spawnbot' (see
<a href="chatting.html">Chatting and shouting</a>).
All bots can be removed with the command '!dropbots'. (They don't disappear immediately, but like a player whose
connection dies would be dropped after a while.)</p>

<p>Note that spawning several bots can introduce a significant momentary delay as all the bot processes are initiated.
Also, the server machine now has to run not only the server but all the bots; drop the bots if it seems that they
cause the server to lose 'frames'.</p>

<p>If the server is full and new players try to connect, bots, if there are any, are automatically dropped to make room.</p>

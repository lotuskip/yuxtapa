<h2>Bots</h2>

<p>At the moment, there are no real, competitive bots in yuxtapa. What there are
are <em>Mr. Browns</em>.</p>

<p>Mr. Browns are bot programs that function like bots in many other multiplayer
games, but don't have any kind of AI. They just move around randomly (hence
the name).</p>

<p>What are they good for? Well...
<ul>
<li>Testing. The main reason they were introduced was that there were not enough people to test multiplaying otherwise.</li>
<li>Target practise. It can actually be difficult to beat them in melee.</li>
</ul>
They tend to drown and fall into chasms a lot.</p>

<p>Admins (see <a href="adminlevels.html">Admin levels</a>) can spawn Mr. Browns in-game (see
<a href="chatting.html">Chatting and shouting</a>).
There is also a command for dropping all the bots.</p>

<p>Spawning several bots can introduce a significant momentary delay as all the bot processes are initiated.
Also, the server machine now has to run not only the server but all the bots; drop the bots if it seems that they
cause the server to lose 'frames'. At the moment this is unlikely, but might become an issue if a more complicated AI
is written for the bots one day.</p>

<p>If the server is full and new players try to connect, bots, if there are any, are automatically dropped to make room.</p>


<h3>Installing Mr. Brown</h3>
<p>For AUR users: the bot executable, named 'mrbrown', is placed in /usr/share/yuxtapa. The rest is for others:</p>

<p>At least at the moment, the bot executable is not built along with the server and the client, but
you must compile it yourself. If at some point the bots get an AI and become generally <em>useful</em>,
they will be added to the release as a third component, just like the client and the server are now.</p>

<p>Go to the directory 'yuxtapa/testes'. There, run 'make'. This
should build an executable called 'mrbrown' in the 'yuxtapa' parent directory. You can move this executable
to some accessible directory (such as '/usr/bin'), but the important thing is that you point the server
configuration to it (see the server configuration file).</p>

<p>After this, bots should be runnable from within the game. They can also be executed stand-alone (but
most people probably don't want this).</p>
